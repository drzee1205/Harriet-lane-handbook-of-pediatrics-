 I. METABOLISM1-7	
A. Clinical Presentation of Metabolic Disease (Box 13.1)
1. Metabolic disease can be conceptualized into broad categories (Table 13.1).
2. When considering a particular diagnosis, a complete patient history, including details of conception, pregnancy, prenatal screening and diagnostic studies, delivery, postnatal growth, development, and a three- generation family history in the form of a pedigree (Fig. EC 13.A) should accompany a comprehensive physical examination. The family history may be remarkable for close relatives who died of similar presentations (may be mistaken for "sepsis" or "SIDS").
3. A high index of suspicion is required, as routine investigations may be unrevealing.
4. Routine newborn screening (see Section II) is meant to detect many metabolic disorders before onset of clinical symptoms, but the condi- tions tested for vary by state and not all countries test, so clinical suspi- cion should remain high if clinical picture is concerning.
B. Evaluation
1. Initial laboratory tests: Comprehensive metabolic panel, blood glucose, venous blood gas (VBG), ammonia (beware false-positives from tour- niquets, struggling children, or sample delay), lactate, creatine kinase (CK), complete blood cell count with differential, urine ketones.
2. Subsequent evaluation for metabolic disease:
a. Consult a geneticist.
b. A basic metabolic work-up includes plasma amino acids (PAA), urine organic acids (UOA), acylcarnitine profile, quantitative (free and total) plasma carnitine, lactate/pyruvate ratio. Further specialized biochemical testing is available.
3. Additional labs given specific circumstances:
a. Metabolic acidosis: Ammonia, lactate, b-hydroxybutyrate, acetoace- tate, UOA, urinalysis with urine pH, acylcarnitine profile, quantitative (free and total) plasma carnitine (Fig. 13.1).
b. Hyperammonemia: VBG, UOA, PAA, acylcarnitine profile, urine orotic acid (Fig. 13.2).

BROAD CLASSIFICATION OF METABOLIC DISEASE1-6






Disorders of reduced fasting tolerance
Disorders in the body's ability to tolerate fasting, with early onset of hypoglycemia. Can present in infancy or later when trying to sleep through the night, including morning symptoms or seizures. Look for laboratory abnormalities and symptoms not usually found in typical fasting.


Table 13.3 Hypoglycemia algo-
rithm Fig. 13.4





Mitochondrial disorders
Defect in energy production through the electron transport chain. There is a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, often involving high- energy organs including brain, muscle, and/or heart.

c. Hypoglycemia: Samples at time of hypoglycemia-glucose, insulin, growth hormone, free fatty acids, b-hydroxybutyrate (see Chapter 10). Cortisol, fasting and postprandial lactate, urine ketones, creatine kinase, acylcarnitine profile, PAA, UOA (Fig. 13.3).
d. Neonatal seizures: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amino acids and PAA, CSF/serum glucose ratio, serum and CSF neurotransmitters, CSF and plasma lactate, plasma very-long-chain fatty acids, UOA, serum uric acid, urine sulfites. Consider trial of pyridoxine.

C. Categories of Metabolic Disorders
1. Intoxication disorders (Table 13.2)
2. Disorders of reduced fasting tolerance (Table 13.3)
3. Disorders of complex molecules (Table 13.4)
4. Mitochondrial disorders (Table 13.5)
5. Neurotransmitter disorders (Table 13.6)
D. Management of Metabolic Crisis
1. Specific acute management available in Tables 13.2-13.6.

Diagnostic approaches to pediatric cardiomyopathy of metabolic genetic etiologies and their rela- tion to therapy. Prog Pediatr Cardiol. 2007;24:15-25)

2. A general guiding principal is to provide hydration and enough glucose to meet the patient's caloric needs to stop catabolism.
a. Use D10% + electrolytes for age at 1.5 to 2 times maintenance rate.
b. Use caution in mitochondrial disorders (and do not use D10 in pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency), because this may enhance lactic acidosis. If uncertain, measure lactate and acid-base status regularly.
3. For unknown/suspected metabolic disease, treatment should not be delayed during work-up.

E. Commonly Used Medications
1. Carnitine 50 mg/kg/dose intravenous (IV) every 6 hours when ill, or 100 mg/kg/day orally (PO) divided every 8 hours when well. For dosing in primary carnitine deficiency, see Formulary.
2. Sodium phenylacetate (10%) + sodium benzoate (10%) (Ammonul) should be combined with arginine HCl in a 25 to 35 mL/kg 10% dex- trose solution and administered through a central venous catheter to treat acute hyperammonemia in a urea cycle patient.
a. For a child less than 20 kg, the dose is 250 mg/kg sodium phenylac- etate and 250 mg/kg sodium benzoate.
b. For a child greater than 20 kg, the dose is 5.5 g/m2 sodium phenyl- acetate and 5.5 g/m2 sodium benzoate.

c. The dose of arginine HCl is 200 to 600 mg/kg, depending on the diagnosis.
(1) 200 mg/kg for carbamylphosphate synthase (CPS) deficiency and ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency.
(2) 600 mg/kg for citrullinemia and argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) deficiency.
d. Administer as a loading dose over 90 to 120 minutes, followed by an equivalent dose as a maintenance infusion over 24 hours.
3. Arginine HCl for MELAS stroke-like episode: bolus of 0.5 g/kg given within 3 hours of symptom onset, followed by an additional 0.5 g/kg administered as a continuous infusion for 24 hours for the next 3 to 5 days.9 (MELAS: mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes)
4. Sodium benzoate for nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH): start with 500 mg/kg/day added to a 24-hour supply of formula or divided at least 4 times daily and consult a biochemical geneticist.10

 II. NEWBORN METABOLIC SCREENING7	
A. Timing
1. First screen should be performed within the first 48 to 72 hours of life (at least 24 hours after initiation of feeding).
2. Second screen (requested in some states) should be performed after 7 days of age.
3. Preterm infants: Perform initial screen at birth (to collect sample before transfusions), another at age 48 to 72 hours, a third at age 7 days, and a final at age 28 days or before discharge (whichever comes first).
B. Abnormal Result
1. Requires immediate follow-up and confirmatory testing; consult a geneticist.
2. ACT Sheets and Confirmatory Algorithms are available for more informa- tion on how to proceed with specific abnormalities: https://www.acmg. net/ACMG/Medical-Genetics-Practice-Resources/ACT_Sheets_and_ Algorithms.aspx (search ACT sheets).
C. Results Affected by Transfusion
Note: Repeat newborn metabolic screen 3 months after last transfusion.
1. Biotinidase enzyme activity
2. Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) activity
3. Hemoglobinopathy evaluation

 III. DYSMORPHOLOGY7,11-14	
A. History
Pertinent history includes pregnancy course, prenatal exposures, type of conception (natural or assisted), perinatal history, developmental mile- stones, and review of systems.
B. Family History
1. Three-generation pedigree focused on both medical and developmental histories (see Fig. EC 13.A).
2. Helpful mnemonics include:
a. SIDE mnemonic15: Anything SIMILAR in the family? Anything INHERITED through the family? Any premature, unexplained DEATHS? Any EXTRAORDINARY events?
b. SCREEN mnemonic16: SOME CONCERNS about conditions running in the family? REPRODUCTION-any issues with pregnancy infertil- ity, or birth defects? EARLY disease, death, or disability? ETHNICITY? NONGENETIC-any other risk factors?
c. Rule of Too/Two13:
(1) Too: tall? short? many? few? early? young? different?
(2) Two: cancers? generations? in the family? birth defects?
3. Patterns of inheritance: See Online Content for discussion of different patterns of inheritance.
C. Physical Examination
1. Major anomalies: Structural anomalies that are found in less than 5% of the population and may cause significant cosmetic or functional impair- ment, often requiring medical or surgical management.
2. Minor anomalies11,12,14,17: Structural anomalies that are found in greater than 5% of the population with little or no cosmetic or functional signifi- cance to the patient.
3. Examples of major and minor anomalies (Table 13.7). Three or more minor anomalies may be a nonspecific indicator of occult or major anomaly.
D. Work-up
1. Imaging to evaluate for major anomalies
a. Head ultrasound (US) or brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
b. Echocardiogram
c. Complete abdominal US
d. Skeletal survey with radiographs composed of: AP views of skull, chest/ribs, upper extremities and hands, lower extremities and feet; lateral views of skull, complete spine, chest, and odontoid view.
2. Dilated eye exam
3. Hearing evaluation
4. Genetic testing: See Fig. 13.4 and Table 13.8. The patient should be referred to genetics for a dysmorphology evaluation and appropriate testing.

2. Cardiomyopathy: Can be from inborn errors of metabolism, channelo- pathies, mutations in genes important for sarcomere and desmosome production/function, or other single gene disorders.
3. Long QT disorders: Many single gene disorders.
B. Ciliopathies
1. Nonmotile ciliopathies: Defects in primary (nonmotile) ciliary function. Cystic renal disease, brain malformations (molar tooth sign), retinal

degeneration, liver congenital hepatic fibrosis, polydactyly, skeletal dysplasia, obesity. Examples: Cystic kidneys as a result of heritable polycystic kidney disease; neurodevelopmental ciliopathies such as Joubert syndrome or Bardet-Biedl syndrome.
2. Primary ciliary dyskinesias: Defects in motile cilia. Recurrent respiratory infections (chronic sinopulmonary disease), infertility, situs inversus. Examples: More than 30 genes known to cause primary ciliary dyskinesia. When situs inversus is present, it is referred to as Kartagener syndrome.
3. Evaluation: Evaluation for potentially affected organ systems, includ- ing abdominal US, echocardiogram, brain MRI, and complete retinal evaluation with ophthalmology. Skeletal survey if limb defects. CMP to
evaluate kidney and liver function. Unless a specific disorder suspected, broad genetic testing is appropriate.
C. Cleft Lip and Palate (CLP)
1. Can be isolated or part of a syndrome.
2. Risk factors: Maternal smoking, heavy alcohol use, systemic corticoste- roid use, folic acid and cobalamin deficiency.18
3. Submucosal clefts may be indicated by a bifid uvula.
4. Evaluation: Children can have difficulties with feeding, speech, and hearing (chronic otitis or hearing loss as part of a syndrome). If not an isolated anom- aly, may need further work-up with ophthalmology and echocardiogram.

5. Examples: Autosomal dominant inheritance seen in Van der Woude syn- drome (associated with lip pits) and Stickler syndrome (can have retinal detachment, hearing loss).
D. Connective Tissue Disorders
1. Consider when a patient has velvety skin, hyperextensible joints, abnormal scarring, poor healing, striae, pectus deformities, tall stature, myopia, lens dislocations, arachnodactyly.
2. Evaluation: Some connective tissue disorders are associated with dilated aorta (echocardiogram), dysplastic vessels, or fragility of lens/retina (ophthalmology evaluation).
3. Examples: Dilated aorta with characteristic physical features in Marfan syndrome; vascular fragility in vascular Ehlers-Danlos (type IV); isolated hyperextensibility of joints in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos (type III).
E. Developmental Delay, Intellectual Disability
1. All children should be offered genetic evaluation.
2. See Chapter 9 for information on evaluation.
3. Examples: Microarray is first tier test because it can detect micro- deletion and microduplication syndromes, such as 1p36 deletion syndrome. FMR1 repeat testing can detect fragile X syndrome and heterozygous females, who can also have developmental delays. Further testing may be indicated to detect monogenic causes, such as Kleefstra syndrome.


F. Deafness, Hard of Hearing
1. Approximately 60% of hearing loss is genetic. It can be syndromic or nonsyndromic.
2. Consider perinatal infectious causes (e.g., cytomegalovirus).
3. Evaluation: Consider connexin 26 and 30 gene testing as first step if nonsyndromic and/or broad gene panel testing. Individualize inner ear/ brain imaging. Ophthalmology assessment, ECG, and renal US should be done for those with negative connexin testing.
4. Examples: Approximately half of nonsyndromic hearing loss is from GJB2 (encodes connexin 26) gene mutations. Syndromic causes include Usher syndrome, which can also have gradual blindness.
G. Hypotonia
1. Central: Abnormalities of brain function, normal strength or axial weakness, preserved/persistent newborn reflexes, normal CK, normal muscle bulk.
a. Evaluation: CK to differentiate. Evaluate for causes such as hypothy- roidism (TSH); evaluate brain structure and function with MRI and EEG.
b. Examples: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, peroxisomal disorders.
2. Peripheral: Alert, profound weakness that is often appendicular, absent reflexes, feeding difficulties, normal or increased CK.
a. Evaluation: Evaluate for causes such as hypothyroidism (TSH) or mitochondrial disease (lactate/pyruvate). Electromyography (EMG) to determine if muscle or nerve affected. Consider that cardiac muscle could be affected (echocardiogram).
b. Examples: Spinal muscular atrophy, myotonic dystrophy, muscular dystrophies.
H. Limb and Stature Disorders
1. Can be defects in collagen formation, bone formation, or remodeling.
2. Evaluation: Radiographic skeletal survey of all bones to localize dyspla- sia. Some disorders, including achondroplasia, can have narrowing at the foramen magnum or cervical instability (flexion/extension C-spine films). There can be a risk of central or peripheral sleep apneas (sleep study). Karyotype for females with short stature to evaluate for Turner syndrome. Unless a specific disorder suspected, broad genetic testing is appropriate.
3. Examples: Rhizomelic limb shortening and narrow foramen magnum seen in achondroplasia. Cervical instability seen in COL2A1 gene muta- tions (spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, Stickler syndrome). The presence of multiple congenital joint contractures is called arthro- gryposis, which is seen in many disorders. Fractures can be seen in osteogenesis imperfecta and hypophosphatasia.
I. Liver Disease
1. Liver failure and/or direct and indirect hyperbilirubinemia can be a manifestation of a metabolic disorder or the result of a genetic


2. Evaluation: Metabolic work-up including PAA, UOA, urine succinylac- etone, very-long-chain fatty acids, urine reducing substances. Some syndromes have ocular features (ophthalmology evaluation). Unless a specific disorder suspected, broad genetic testing is appropriate.
3. Examples: Cholestasis found in progressive familial intrahepatic cho- lestasis (type 1, 2, and 3). Liver dysfunction can be seen in tyrosinemia. Indirect/unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can be seen in Gilbert and Crigler-Najjar syndromes.
J. Oncologic Disorders19
1. Approximately 9% of pediatric oncology patients have a heritable cancer predisposition syndrome or germline mutation. This puts them and affected family members at risk for certain cancers and may affect their individualized treatments.
2. Obtain a thorough family history with specific cancer diagnoses and age of diagnosis.
3. Evaluation: Many cancers warrant referral. Genetic testing is tailored to each specific diagnosis. Examples include myelodysplastic syndrome, medulloblastoma, atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor, sarcomas, pituitary blastoma, and many more.
4. Examples: Early onset of cancers in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (espe- cially sarcoma) and von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (especially hemangioblastoma).
K. Overgrowth
1. Generalized overgrowth can result in macrosomia at birth or height and/ or head circumference greater than the 98th percentile.
2. Hemihypertrophy of a limb may be the result of mosaicism from somatic changes.
3. Be aware that certain overgrowth syndromes have associated cancer risks and may require routine monitoring (e.g., abdominal US screening in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome).
4. Evaluation: Disorder-specific genetic testing based on exam findings; may require skin biopsy. In some disorders, internal organs can be affected (echocardiogram, ECG, renal US).
5. Examples: Generalized overgrowth with developmental delays can be the result of Sotos syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, or others. Segmental overgrowth/hemihypertrophy can result from somatic PIK3CA mutations affecting the brain (MCAP syndrome) or a limb (Klippel- Trénaunay syndrome).
L. Seizure Disorders
1. Consider genetics especially with positive family history, intractable epilepsy, infantile onset, developmental regression, intellectual disability, dysmorphic features, autism, or brain malformations.
2. Can be the result of metabolic conditions or syndromic disorders.
3. Increased recurrence risk in families even if no genetic cause identified.
4. Evaluation: Consideration of microarray, epilepsy panels, or whole exome sequencing (particularly if dysmorphic features present);


consider biochemical testing for inborn errors of metabolism; physical exam with Wood's lamp for cutaneous manifestations (e.g., hypopig- mented macules).
5. Examples: Sodium channel defects (SCN1A mutations) can lead to a broad spectrum of seizures. Accompanying dermatologic findings can be characteristic for neurocutaneous disorders, including neurofibroma- tosis type 1 and tuberous sclerosis.
M. Skin Pigmentation Alterations
1. Can be the result of post-zygotic mosaicism. As a result, genetic variants may only be detectable in affected skin and not in blood.
2. Skin and the central nervous system are derived from the same neural crest lineage; many skin pigmentation anomalies have associated cen- tral nervous system abnormalities, including malformations or seizures. Often referred to as neurocutaneous disorders.
3. Evaluation: Examination with a Wood's lamp, ophthalmology evaluation
4. Examples: Multiple café-au-lait macules seen in neurofibromatosis type 1 and Legius syndrome. Genetic mosaicism in skin can lead to a pigmentation pattern called hypomelanosis of Ito.
N. Vascular Anomalies
1. Can involve arterial, vascular, and lymphatic systems. Can be caused by germline mutations or postzygotic somatic changes (mosaicism). Some are associated with segmental overgrowth.
2. Vascular syndromes can cause clinically significant arteriovenous mal- formations and arteriovenous fistulas in the skin, internal organs, and brain/spine.
3. Evaluation: Examine mucosal membranes. Some disorders require evaluation for intraorganal arteriovenous malformations with abdominal US and/or MRI/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of brain and spine. Several disorders are autosomal dominant-obtain family history for vascular lesions.
4. Examples: Autosomal dominant history of multiple capillary malforma- tions could be from RASA1 mutations. Port-wine stains seen in Sturge- Weber syndrome. Telangiectasias on lips, nose, and hands seen in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

 V. ETIOLOGIES OF DYSMORPHIC FEATURES (FIG. 13.5)11,14,29	
A. Aneuploidy
Abnormal number of chromosomes.
1. Aneuploidy syndromes are most commonly due to maternal nondisjunc- tion and more rarely due to chromosomal translocation or mosaicism. Risk increases with maternal age.
2. The evaluation for aneuploidy often begins prenatally with a first trimes- ter screen (nuchal translucency, nasal bone, free ß-human chorionic gonadotropin [ß-hCG], PAPP-A) or circulating cell-free fetal DNA analy- sis showing increased risk.


3. Prenatal diagnostic testing options include chorionic villus sampling in the first trimester or amniocentesis during or after the second trimester.
4. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) may be performed in the first 24 to 48 hours of life to indicate number of chromosomes but will not determine the morphology of the chromosomes (e.g., if a translocation is present). Therefore karyotype analysis is still indicated in aneuploidy syndromes, both to provide a diagnosis and to provide accurate genetic counseling.
5. Specific aneuploidy syndromes:
a. Down syndrome (Trisomy 21):
(1) Features: Hypotonia and characteristic facial features (brachy- cephaly, epicanthal folds, flat nasal bridge, upward-slanting pal- pebral fissures, Brushfield spots, small mouth and ears), excess skin at the nape of the neck, single transverse palmar crease, short fifth finger with clinodactyly, wide gap between the first and second toes. Intellectual disability present in all, but severity is variable.
(2) Full health supervision guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) are available (see Section VII).
(3) In brief: In addition to karyotype, neonates should have echocar- diogram to assess for congenital heart disease, ophthalmologic evaluation to assess for cataracts, hearing screen, complete blood count (CBC) to assess for transient myeloproliferative disease, thyroid studies to assess for hypothyroidism, and referral to early intervention services. Annual thyroid studies, CBC (add ferritin and CRP for any child at risk of iron deficiency), hearing and vision assessments. Cervical spine x-ray at age 3 years if asymp- tomatic (sooner imaging with immediate neurosurgical referral if symptomatic). Monitor for signs of obstructive sleep apnea and neurologic dysfunction.
b. Edwards syndrome (Trisomy 18):
(1) Features: Intrauterine growth restriction and polyhydramnios, small for gestational age at birth, clenched hands with overlap- ping fingers, hypoplastic nails, short sternum, prominent occiput, low-set and structurally abnormal ears, micrognathia, rocker- bottom feet, congenital heart disease, cystic and horseshoe kidneys, seizures, hypertonia, significant developmental and cognitive impairments.
(2) Ninety percent die before 1 year of life.
c. Patau syndrome (Trisomy 13):
(1) Features: Defects of forebrain development (holoprosencephaly), severe developmental disability, low-set malformed ears, cleft lip and palate (CLP), microphthalmia, aplasia cutis congenita, poly- dactyly (most frequently of the postaxial type), narrow hypercon- vex nails, apneic spells, cryptorchidism, congenital heart defects.
(2) Ninety-five percent die before 6 months of life.


d. Turner syndrome (45, X):
(1) Features: Short stature, gonadal dysgenesis with amenorrhea and lack of a pubertal growth spurt, broad chest with hypoplastic or inverted nipples, webbed neck. The diagnosis should be consid- ered prenatally in a female fetus with hydrops, increased nuchal translucency, cystic hygroma, or lymphedema. Intelligence is usually normal, but patients are at risk for cognitive, behavioral, and social disabilities.
(2) Full health supervision guidelines from the AAP are available (see Section VII).
(3) In brief: Obtain baseline echocardiogram, renal US, ophthalmol- ogy and audiology evaluations. Routine thyroid testing, biochemi- cal liver tests, HgbA1C, vitamin D, TTG and immunoglobulin A (IgA), audiology, skin examinations, bone mineral density, and skeletal assessments.
e. Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY; 48, XXYY; 48, XXXY; and 49, XXXXY):
(1) Features: Primary hypogonadism, which may present in infancy with hypospadias or cryptorchidism or in adolescence/adulthood with infertility, gynecomastia, and small testes. Children may have expressive language delay.
(2) There is an increased risk of breast carcinoma in 47, XXY.
(3) Testosterone therapy is indicated at puberty for hypergonado- tropic hypogonadism.
B. Copy Number Variation (Deletions and Duplications)
Partial loss or additional copies of genetic material on part of a chromosome.
1. 22q11 Deletion syndrome (Velocardiofacial syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome)
a. Features: Congenital heart disease (tetralogy of Fallot, interrupted aortic arch, ventricular septal defect [VSD], and truncus arteriosus most common), palatal abnormalities (velopharyngeal incompetence, cleft palate), characteristic facial features in approximately two- thirds, developmental delays, learning disabilities, immunodeficiency, hypocalcemia, feeding problems, renal anomalies, hearing loss, laryngotracheoesophageal anomalies, growth hormone deficiency, autoimmune disorders, seizures (with or without hypocalcemia), and psychiatric disorders.
b. Diagnostic evaluation: Microarray; FISH is no longer recommended. Assessments should include serum calcium, absolute lymphocyte count, B- and T-cell subsets, renal US, chest x-ray, cardiac examina- tion, and echocardiogram.
c. Health supervision: Health supervision recommendations have been published. Hold live vaccines until immune function is assessed.
2. 5p- Syndrome (Cri-du-chat syndrome)
a. Features: High pitched cry, delayed development, intellectual dis- ability, microcephaly, low birth weight, hypotonia, hypertelorism, low


set ears, small jaw, round face, congenital heart disease (VSD, atrial septal defect [ASD], PDA).
b. Diagnostic evaluation: Can be detected on karyotype or microarray.
3. 1p36 Deletion syndrome
a. Features: Developmental delay, intellectual disability, delayed growth, hypotonia, seizures, speech delay, hearing and vision impairment, microcephaly, low ears with thick helices, congenital heart disease (structural defects or cardiomyopathy).
b. Diagnostic evaluation: Microarray.
C. Disorders of Methylation/Epigenetics
Heritable changes that affect gene activity and expression.
1. Prader-Willi syndrome
a. Features: Severe hypotonia and feeding difficulties in infancy, fol- lowed by an insatiable appetite in later infancy or early childhood. Developmental delays in motor and language abilities. All affected individuals have some degree of intellectual disability. Short stature is common; males and females have hypogonadism, and in most, infertility.
b. Diagnostic evaluation: Results from missing paternally contributed region. Methylation testing can detect almost all individuals-whether due to abnormal paternal-specific imprinting, a paternal deletion, or maternal uniparental disomy within the Prader-Willi/Angelman critical region of 15q. Follow-up with further molecular testing.
c. Health supervision: Full health supervision guidelines from the AAP are available (see Section VII). Monitor for feeding difficul- ties in infancy and close supervision beginning in childhood to prevent obesity. Evaluate for and treat hypothyroidism, sleep apnea (central and obstructive), central adrenal insufficiency,21 and cryptorchidism.
d. Treatment: Growth hormone can be beneficial, and hormone replace- ment therapy can aid in sexual development.
2. Angelman syndrome
a. Features: Happy demeanor, hand-flapping, and fascination with water. Severe developmental delay, intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, gait ataxia, tremulous limbs, hypotonia, micro- cephaly, and seizures.
b. Diagnostic evaluation: Results from missing maternally contributed region. Methylation testing can detect almost all individuals-whether due to abnormal maternal-specific imprinting, a maternal deletion, or paternal uniparental disomy within the Prader-Willi/Angelman critical region of 15q. Some individuals can be detected through UBE3A sequence analysis.
c. Health supervision: Monitor for seizures, behavior problems, feeding issues, sleep disturbance, scoliosis, strabismus, constipation, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.


d. Treatment: Antiepileptic drugs for seizures; be careful not to over- treat, because Angelman syndrome also associated with movement abnormalities (avoid carbamazepine, vigabatrin, and tiagabine).22 Speech therapy with a focus on nonverbal communication. Sedatives for nighttime wakefulness.
3. Classic Rett syndrome: X-linked disease present only in females because pathogenic MECP2 variants are most often lethal in males who have only one X chromosome. Males who do survive with MECP2 mutations have presentation different from Rett syndrome that often incudes neonatal encephalopathy.
a. Features: Neurodevelopmental syndrome that presents after 6 to 18 months of typical development with acquired microcephaly, then developmental stagnation, followed by rapid regression. Gait ataxia or inability to ambulate, repetitive, stereotypical handwringing, fits of screaming or inconsolable crying, episodic breathing abnormalities
(sighing, apnea, or hyperpnea), tremors, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
b. Diagnostic evaluation: Molecular testing of MECP2.
c. Health Supervision: Regular ECG to evaluate QT interval,23 monitor for scoliosis.
D. Repeat Expansion
Pathogenic expansion of trinucleotide repeats during DNA replication.
1. Fragile X syndrome
a. Most common cause of inherited intellectual disability.
b. Features: Males have relative macrocephaly and prominent ears. Postpubertal macroorchidism and tall stature that slows in ado- lescence. Females have a range of intellectual disability due to the degree of X inactivation of the affected chromosome. Female
premutation carriers (55 to 200 repeats) can develop primary ovarian insufficiency; males with 55 to 200 repeats can have a tremor/ataxia phenotype.
c. Diagnostic evaluation: Repeat expansion testing of FMR1 gene to assess number of CGG trinucleotide repeats (typically >200 in fragile X syndrome).
d. Health supervision: Full health supervision guidelines from the AAP are available (see Section VII). Symptom and supportive psychophar- macologic medications.
2. Other examples include Huntington disease (CAG repeats), myotonic dystrophy (CTG repeats), and Friedrich ataxia (GAA repeats).
E. Mendelian/Single Gene Disorders
Mutation in a single gene causing a disorder.
1. Marfan syndrome
a. Features: Myopia, ectopia lentis, aortic dilatation with predisposition to rupture, mitral valve prolapse, pneumothorax, bone overgrowth and joint laxity, pectus carinatum or excavatum, scoliosis, pes planus.


b. Diagnostic evaluation: Clinical diagnosis based on the revised Ghent criteria (a "systemic score" system based on clinical features that can support a diagnosis if score is greater than or equal to 7). Molecular genetic testing of FBN1 gene.
c. Health supervision: Annual ophthalmologic examination; annual echo- cardiography; intermittent surveillance of the entire aorta with computed tomography (CT) or MRA scans beginning in young adulthood. Avoid contact sports, competitive sports, isometric exercise. Full health super- vision guidelines from the AAP are available (see Section VII).
d. Treatment: ß-blocker (atenolol) and/or an angiotensin-II type 1 recep- tor blocker (losartan) is current standard of care. Valve-sparing sur- gery to replace aortic root when diameter exceeds ~4.5 cm in adults (or if rates of aortic dilation exceed ~0.5 cm/year) and significant aortic regurgitation is present.24
2. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS)
a. Features: Smooth, velvety, hyperextensible skin, widened scars, poor healing, easy bruising, joint hypermobility with recurrent dislocations, chronic joint or limb pain, and a positive family history. The vascular- type EDS is distinct and involves translucent skin, characteristic facies (pinched nose), as well as risk for arterial, intestinal, and uterine fragility or rupture.
b. Diagnostic evaluation: Clinical evaluation and family history. For clas- sical and vascular types, echocardiogram and DNA testing. Vascular type additionally needs MRI/MRA imaging of aorta and iliac arteries. Joint hypermobility can be scored with Beighton criteria. No known genetic cause of hypermobile type.
c. Treatment: Physical therapy to improve joint stability, low-resistance exercise, and pain medications as needed; treat gastroesophageal reflux. Vascular EDS requires management in a clinic specializing in connective tissue disorders.
3. Achondroplasia
a. Features: Short arms and legs (especially rhizomelia); bowing of the lower legs; large head with characteristic facial features including frontal bossing and midface retrusion. Infantile hypotonia is typical, followed
by delayed motor development. Gibbus deformity of the thoracolumbar spine leads to exaggerated lumbar lordosis. Rarely, children have hydro- cephalus and restrictive pulmonary disease. Stenosis at the foramen magnum in infancy increases the risk of death; lumbar spinal stenosis may present in childhood but is more common in adulthood. Intelligence and lifespan are usually normal. Average adult height for males and females is approximately 4 feet.
b. Diagnostic evaluation: Clinical diagnosis based on characteristic physi- cal exam. FGFR3 mutation testing available if diagnostic uncertainty.
c. Health supervision: Full health supervision guidelines from the AAP are available (see Section VII). In brief: Use standard growth charts for achondroplasia. Baseline head CT including cervicomedullary junction in infancy, and precautions against uncontrolled head


movement or neck manipulation. Monitor for signs of obstructive sleep apnea, middle ear complications (e.g., otitis media), or spinal stenosis (more common in adults).
F. Teratogen Exposure (Table 13.10)
G. In utero Forces25
1. Uterine compression:
a. Can be intrinsic (oligohydramnios, multiple fetuses, uterine deformi- ties) or extrinsic (small pelvis).
b. Results in deformations, including craniofacial (plagiocephaly, flat- tened facies, crumpled ear, craniosynostosis), extremities (dislocated hips, equinovarus or calcaneovalgus feet, tibial bowing, contrac- tures), torticollis, lung hypoplasia, scoliosis.

 VI. CONSENT AND DISCLOSURE OF GENETIC TESTING	
A. Ethics of Genetic Testing in Pediatrics
Genetic testing in pediatric patients poses unique challenges given that chil- dren require proxies (most often parents) to give consent for testing. Several publications and statements have been made with regard to genetic testing in children, including the "Ethical Issues with Genetic Testing in Pediatrics" statement made by the AAP.26 Important considerations include:
1. Testing and screening of a pediatric patient should be in his/her best interest and provide clear benefits.
2. If testing is performed for the interests of parents or other family mem- bers, it should not be to the detriment of the child.
3. Treatment and/or follow-up must be available after testing is sent.
4. Carrier testing or screening in children and adolescents is not broadly supported.
5. Predictive testing for late-onset disorders is discouraged until a patient is able to make an autonomous decision; in these cases, extensive pre- test counseling is recommended.
B. Informed Consent
Pretest counseling and informed consent are important prior to sending any genome-wide testing and documentation of informed consent is recom- mended. Possible results from genetic testing include:
1. Positive-a causative/related variant is found.
2. Negative-either no causative/related variant is present, or the avail- able technology or scope of the test methodology was unable to detect the causative/related variant. A negative result does not guarantee the condition does not have a genetic etiology.
3. Variant(s) of uncertain significance-variants for which the meaning is uncertain (could be variants without clinical significance or related to the patient's presentation but not previously reported).
4. Incidental finding(s)-variants anticipated to affect the patient's health that are unrelated to the indication for sending the test (and may be an adult-onset condition).
5. Discovery that parents are blood relatives and/or nonmaternity/nonpaternity.
C. Professional Disclosure of Familial Genetic Information
Pretest counseling should include the discussion that genetic testing may have implications for family members. With regard to disclosure of genetic testing results to at-risk family members when a patient or family member chooses not to disclose, the provider must weigh the duty to respect privacy and autonomy of the patient with the duty to prevent harm in another identifiable person. The ethical and legal duties of the physician are not well


defined. The American Society of Human Genetics released a statement on professional disclosure of familial genetic information which outlines "exceptional circumstances," which if all are present, disclosure may be
permissible: (1) attempts to encourage disclosure by the patient have failed,
(2) harm is "highly likely" to occur, (3) the harm is "serious and foreseeable,"
(4) either the disease is preventable/treatable, or early monitoring will reduce risks, (5) the at-risk relative(s) are identifiable, and (6) the harm of failure to disclose outweighs the harm that may result from disclosure.27
D. Disclosure of Incidental Findings
Patients are sometimes given the option to be informed of any incidental or secondary findings when they pursue genetic testing, but in general, it is rec- ommended that incidental findings should be reported when there is strong evidence of benefit to the patient. The minimal list of reportable incidental findings may be found in the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) March 2013 statement and related updates.28

A. Patterns of Inheritance
1. Autosomal dominant:
a. Disease manifestation with a variant in one allele of a gene; the other allele is normal.
b. It can appear in multiple generations.
c. An affected individual has a 50% risk of passing on the variant with
each pregnancy.
2. Autosomal recessive:
a. Disease manifestation requiring variants in both alleles of the gene.
b. There can be multiple affected individuals in the same generation.
c. An affected couple (each being a carrier) has a 25% chance of hav- ing an affected child, a 25% chance of having an unaffected child, and a 50% chance of producing a carrier of the condition with each pregnancy.
3. X-linked:
a. Because females have two X chromosomes and males have only one X chromosome, males are more commonly and more severely affected by X-linked conditions. Females can be unaffected or have a spectrum of manifestations. In carrier females, lyonization is the process of silencing one X chromosome in each cell and "unfavorable lionization" can result in a large proportion of cells that inactivated the normal X chromosome, and as a result clinical features are present.
b. Females have a 50% chance of passing on an affected X to each male or female child. Males will pass on the affected X to all female children and will have unaffected sons.
4. Mitochondrial:
a. Classically a matrilineal inheritance pattern, caused by mitochondrial DNA inherited from one's mother that contributes to mitochondrial function. Sons will be affected but cannot pass the condition on to their offspring.
b. There may be significant phenotypic variability due to "hetero- plasmy," in which the relative proportion of affected and unaffected mitochondria may change as cells divide.
c. Mitochondrial disease is currently known to be caused by either vari- ants in mitochondrial DNA or by recessive variants in nuclear genes that code for proteins that function in the mitochondria.
5. Genomic imprinting and uniparental disomy:
a. The two alleles of a gene may be functionally equivalent but may be expressed or silenced depending on the parent of origin of the chromosome. This is due to the presence of epigenetic machinery influencing the expression of genes and resulting in different meth- ylation patterns.
b. Uniparental disomy is a rare occurance in which offspring have inherited both copies of a chromosome from one parent. There are two types: (1) Uniparental isodisomy is an error in meiosis II, in


which the offspring receives two identical copies of a chromosome from one parent. This can result in autosomal recessive disorders because any variant on one parental allele could be present on both alleles of their offspring. (2) Uniparental heterodisomy is an error
in meiosis I, in which the offspring receives both copies of a single parent's chromosome. This can result in disorders of imprinting because only one parent contributed to the epigenetic pattern of that chromosome.

 I. ANEMIA	
A. Screening for Anemia
1. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends screening between 9 and 12 months with a repeat level in 6 months.
2. Screen yearly in high-risk children: history of prematurity or low birth weight, exposure to lead, exclusive breastfeeding without supplemental iron beyond 4 months, diet without iron-fortified cereals or foods natu- rally rich in iron, feeding problems, poor growth, inadequate nutrition.1
B. Definition of Anemia
1. Anemia is defined as a reduction in hemoglobin (Hb) two standard deviations below the mean, based on age-specific norms.
2. See Table 14.1 at the end of the chapter for age-specific blood cell indices.
C. Causes of Anemia
1. See Fig. 14.1 for approach to anemia based on red blood cell (RBC) pro- duction, as measured by reticulocyte count and cell size. Note that normal ranges for Hb and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) are age-dependent.
2. See Tables 14.2 and 14.3 for more details regarding specific causes of nonhemolytic and hemolytic anemia.
D. Evaluation of Anemia
1. Useful equations in the evaluation of anemia:
a. Mentzer index2 = MCV/RBC
(1) Index >13 suggests iron deficiency anemia (IDA).
(2) Index <13 suggests thalassemia trait.
(3) Sensitivity: 62% for IDA, 86% for beta thalassemia trait. Specificity: 86% for IDA, 62% for thalassemia.
b. Reticulocyte index = % reticulocytes × patient hematocrit/normal hematocrit3
(1) >2 is indicative of increased RBC production in appropriate response to anemia.
(2) <2 is evidence of hypoproliferative anemia.
2. Other useful indices and tests
a. RBC distribution width (RDW):
(1) Normal in thalassemia.
(2) Increased in IDA and sideroblastic anemia.
b. Mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC): Hb/hematocrit (Hct):
(1) Allows for classification of anemia as hypochromic, normochro-

328

mic, or hyperchromic.




NONHEMOLYTIC ANEMIA


Iron deficiency anemia (IDA)

Causes: Poor intake, malnutrition, GI bleed, menstrual cycle, malabsorp- tion (with celiac disease, Helicobacter pylori, IBD).
Ferritin falls first. Low MCHC, elevated transferrin receptor, low reticulocyte Hb content. Usually normocytic; microcytic if severe or prolonged.


Anemia of chronic disease


Typically secondary to prolonged/frequent infections, autoimmune condi- tions (SLE, JIA, IBD), vasculitis.3
Low iron, TIBC, transferrin. High ferritin, CRP, and ESR.


Endocrine disease	Hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, panhypopituitarism, hyperparathyroid- ism (primary or secondary).

Lead poisoning	Lead interferes with iron absorption and inhibits heme synthesis enzymes.
Acquired Failure


Secondary red cell
aplasia

Causes: Infection (parvovirus B19, EBV, CMV, HHV-6, HIV, hepatitis), radiation,
medications, collagen vascular disease.
Variable RBC size, variable platelet and WBC counts.
Aspirate bone marrow for evidence of dysfunction, neoplasm, infection.

Membrane Disorders
Hereditary spherocytosis	Inheritance: 75% AD. 25% spontaneous mutation or AR.
Protein defect ? membrane instability ? RBC destruction via extravascular hemolysis.
Diagnosis: Family history with clinical suspicion and spherocytes on smear, osmotic fragility test, EMA flow cytometry if unclear clinical picture.
Treatment: Folate supplementation if moderate-severe hemolysis, anticipatory guidance, splenectomy (for severe disease), cholecystectomy if needed for symptomatic cholelithiasis.

Enzyme Deficiencies






Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency	Inheritance: AR disorder of PKLR or PKM genes causes chronic
hemolysis.

(2) Low MCHC in iron deficiency and thalassemia.
(3) Elevated MCHC and spherocytes in hereditary spherocytosis and hemolytic disease of the newborn.
c. Serum ferritin:
(1) Reflects total body iron stores after 6 months of age.
(2) It is the first value to fall in early iron deficiency and is elevated with inflammation or infection.
d. Coombs test:4
(1) Direct (direct antiglobulin testing [DAT]): Detects antibody/com- plement bound to patient's RBCs by mixing prepared nonspe- cific antihuman globulin with patient's blood. RBC agglutination
= positive test.
(2) Indirect (indirect antiglobulin testing): Detects antibodies to RBC antigens in patient's plasma by mixing reagent RBCs with patient's serum. RBC agglutination = positive test.
e. Hemoglobin electrophoresis:
(1) Involves separation of Hb variants based on molecular charge and size. All positive sickle preparations and solubility tests for sickle Hb (e.g., Sickledex) should be confirmed with electropho- resis or isoelectric focusing (component of mandatory newborn screening in many states).
(2) See Table 14.4 for neonatal Hb electrophoresis patterns.
(3) See Fig. 14.2 for changes in Hb polypeptide over time in a normal fetus/infant.
f. Blood smear interpretation3
(1) Howell-Jolly bodies = impaired splenic function, post-splenectomy
(2) Target cells = hemoglobinopathies, liver disease, post- splenectomy, thalassemia, HbSS, HbSC, HbC
(3) Bite cells, Heinz bodies = G6PD deficiency (during hemolysis)
(4) Toxic granulation of neutrophils, bandemia, atypical lympho- cytes = infection
(5) Pencil poikilocytes = IDA, thalassemia
(6) Basophilic stippling = lead poisoning, sideroblastic anemia
(7) Pappenheimer bodies = sideroblastic anemia
(8) Hypersegmented neutrophils = Vitamin B12, folate deficiencies
(9) Blasts = leukemia, lymphoma
(10) Schistocytes (RBC fragments) = MAHA, burns, valve hemolysis
(11) Spherocytes = autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hereditary sphe- rocytosis, ABO incompatibility/hemolytic disease of the newborn
(12) Elliptocytes = hereditary elliptocytosis, severe IDA
(13) Teardrop cells = myelofibrosis (and other BM infiltrating pro- cesses), thalassemia
(14) Echinocytes (Burr cells) = uremic patients
(15) Acanthocytes (Spur cells) = liver disease
(16) See Figs. EC 14.A to EC 14.L for examples of peripheral smears.

E. Management of Anemia
1. Iron deficiency anemia
a. Oral iron (ferrous sulfate)
(1) Empirically treat children with microcytic anemia and history of poor dietary iron.5
(2) In anemia of chronic disease, only use iron supplementation if evidence of absolute iron deficiency and ferritin <100 ng/mL.5
(3) After initiation of iron supplementation, expect reticulocyte count to increase within the first week with a 1 g/dL increase in Hb in 4 weeks (if severe anemia with Hb <9 g/dL, a response should be seen in 2 weeks).1
b. Iron transfusion (low molecular weight iron dextran6 or iron sucrose7) is appropriate for children with iron malabsorption (PPI use, short bowel syndrome, primary malabsorption), poor response to oral
iron therapy, inability to tolerate oral iron therapy, and hemodialysis- dependent patients receiving erythropoietin.
2. Sickle cell anemia
a. Etiology: Caused by a genetic defect in ß-globin that leads to polymer- ization and sickling with deoxygenation, leading to hemolysis, adher- ence to blood vessel endothelium, and vaso-occlusive ischemia.
b. Most common subtypes: HbSS (sickle cell anemia) and HbSß0 (sickle-ß0-thalassemia) are most severe. HbSC (sickle-hemoglobin C disease) and HbSß+ (sickle-ß+-thalassemia) are often milder.
c. Diagnosis: Often made on newborn screen with Hb electrophoresis. The sickle preparation and Sickledex are rapid tests that are positive in all sickle hemoglobinopathies. False-negative test results may be seen in neonates and other patients with a high percentage of fetal Hb.
d. Complications: See Table 14.5. A hematologist should be consulted.
e. Acute management of anemia in sickle cell disease8:
(1) RBC exchange transfusions: Indicated for patients with symp- tomatic severe acute chest syndrome (ACS), stroke, intractable pain crisis, intrahepatic cholestasis, hepatic sequestration, refractory priapism, and multisystem organ failure. Also indi- cated for children with prior stroke or transcranial Doppler read- ing >200 cm/sec.8 Replace with HbS-negative cells. Follow Hct carefully with goal Hct <30% to avoid hyperviscosity.9
(2) Do not transfuse for asymptomatic anemia, acute kidney injury, or recurrent splenic sequestration.
f. Chronic management and health maintenance8: See Table 14.6. Ongoing consultation and clinical involvement with a pediatric hema- tologist and/or sickle cell program are essential.
3. Thalassemia
a. Etiology: Defects in a- or ß-globin production leads to precipitation of excess chains, causing ineffective erythropoiesis and shortened survival of mature RBCs.



SICKLE CELL DISEASE COMPLICATIONS
Complication Presentation	Additional Testing	Disposition/Treatment

Fever	>101°F or 38.3°C	Blood cultures CXR
Blood and urine cultures Throat and CSF cultures, if
indicated

Admit if ill-appearing, temperature =40°C, infiltrate on CXR or abnormal SpO2, WBC >30,000/µL or
<5,000/µL, platelets <100,000/µL, Hb <5 g/dL, history of sepsis.
Antibiotics: Ceftriaxone IV. Vancomycin if meningitis suspected or if severe illness. Clindamycin or levofloxacin if cephalosporin allergy.34
Consider additional disease-specific coverage.
If outpatient, return in 24 hr for second ceftriaxone dose.

Vaso-
occlusive crisis

Dactylitis in <2 years old; unifocal or multifocal pain in >2 years old

Type and screen	Admit if signs of complications or pain not managed in outpatient setting.
Recommendations for home pain control:
 Mild-moderate pain: NSAIDs.
 Moderate-severe pain: oxycodone, morphine, hydrocodone.
Recommendations for emergency department or inpatient pain control:
 Use IV opioids (morphine, hydromorphone). Use fentanyl if renal or hepatic dysfunction.
 Use PCA and provide as needed doses for breakthrough pain. Schedule pain medication if not
using PCA.35
 Ketamine may be appropriate if poor response to opioids.36
IV fluids as needed for dehydration. Evidence-based guidelines regarding amount or type of fluids are lacking.37
Use incentive spirometry to reduce risk of ACS. Avoid transfusion unless other indication.



Splenic
sequestra- tion

Acutely enlarged spleen, Hb =2 g/dL below baseline

Type and screen	Admit for serial abdominal exams, IV fluid resuscitation.
Simple transfusion if severe anemia.
aBe cautious with transfused volume and use 5-10 mL/kg aliquots if hemodynamically stable as autotransfusion from spleen can cause rebound increase in Hb and viscosity.

Aplastic crisisAcute illness (often viral, commonly parvovirus B19) + Hb < baseline,
low reticulocyte countType and screen Parvovirus serology and

340	Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information

b. a-Thalassemia:
(1) Silent carriers (a-/aa): Not anemic; Hb electrophoresis usually normal.
(2) a-Thalassemia trait (a-/a-) or (aa/-): Causes mild microcytic anemia from birth; Hb electrophoresis usually normal. Hb Barts can be seen in infancy (e.g., on state newborn screens) in patients with a-thalassemia trait.
(3) HbH disease (ß4) (a-/--): Causes moderately severe anemia from birth; HbH (ß-tetramer) may be seen on newborn screen and subsequent electrophoresis.
(4) Hb Bart/hydrops fetalis (--/--): Hb Barts (?4) cannot deliver oxygen; usually fatal in utero or in neonatal period.
c. ß-Thalassemia: Ineffective erythropoiesis is more severe in ß-thalassemia than a-thalassemia. Patients often develop more severe iron overload from increased enteral absorption and transfusions. Adult Hb electropho- resis with decreased Hb A, increased Hb A2, and increased Hb F.
(1) Thalassemia trait/thalassemia minor (ß/ß+) or (ß/ß0): Mildly decreased ß-globin production. Usually asymptomatic with mild anemia.
(2) Thalassemia intermedia (ß+/ß+): Markedly decreased ß-globin production. Presents at about 2 years of age with moderate com- pensated anemia (Hb 7 to 10 g/dL). Wide variability in presenta- tion that may include features noted as follows.
(3) Thalassemia major/Cooley anemia (ß0/ß0, ß+/ß0, or ß+/ß+): Minimal to no ß-globin production. Presence of anemia within first 6 months of life requiring regular transfusions. Overstimulation of bone marrow, ineffective erythropoiesis, and iron overload results in jaundice, growth failure, hypersplenism, gallstones, skeletal abnormalities, liver cirrhosis, and cardiac impairment.
d. Management10
(1) Patients with thalassemia major are transfusion dependent. Patients with thalassemia intermedia may need occasional transfusions.
(2) Transfuse every 3 to 5 weeks for goal pretransfusion Hb 9 to
10.5 mg/dL.
(3) Goal posttransfusion Hb <14 to 15 g/dL due to risk of hypervis- cosity and stroke.
(4) Treat iron overload with chelation (deferoxamine), which should be initiated in thalassemia major after 10 to 20 transfusions or when ferritin >1000 µg/L.
(5) Bone marrow transplant is curative.

 II. NEUTROPENIA	
A. Definition of Neutropenia
1. Neutropenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC)
<1500/µL. Severe neutropenia is defined as an ANC <500/µL.

Chapter 14 Hematology	341

2. See Table 14.7 at the end of the chapter for age-specific leukocyte differentials.
3. Repeat CBC 2 to 3 weeks later to determine if transient (e.g., secondary to a medication, infection) or persistent.11
B. Causes and Evaluation of Neutropenia11
1. CBC +/- blood smear should be obtained to evaluate neutrophil mor- phology and concurrent presence of anemia or thrombocytopenia.
2. If pancytopenic, obtain bone marrow aspiration and biopsy with cytogenetics.
3. If persistent neutropenia for more than 2 to 4 weeks, consider further workup based on potential etiologies (Table 14.8).
C. Management of Neutropenia
1. Additional diagnostic testing:12
a. Repeat CBC 2×/week for 6 to 8 weeks for cyclic neutropenia.
b. Reticulocyte Index to differentiate between destructive processes and marrow failure.
c. Blood smear for morphologic abnormalities.
d. Immunologic testing (Coombs test, anti-double-stranded DNA, anti- neutrophil antibody) for autoimmune or alloimmune processes.
e. IgG, IgA, IgM, lymphocyte subtypes for immunodeficiency.
2. Treatment:
a. Myeloid-specific cytokine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; filgrastim).
(1) Indications for continuous use: Severe congenital neutropenia, cyclic neutropenia, glycogen storage disease 1b, bone marrow failure (e.g., aplastic anemia, Schwachman Diamond-Oski syndrome).12,13
(2) Indications for intermittent use: Life-threatening infection or history of recurrent or serious infections in patients with neutropenia.12
(3) Side effects: Bone pain, headache, rashes.
b. Stem cell transplant: Indicated for bone marrow failure (e.g., Fanconi anemia), poor response to G-CSF, severe congenital neutropenia with high risk of myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukemia.12
3. Complications: See Chapter 22 for management of neutropenic fever and typhlitis.
4. Anticipatory guidance:11
a. Maintain good oral hygiene and skin care to prevent local infections.
b. Avoid rectal temperatures, rectal examinations, or rectal medications due to risk of mucosal trauma and bacteremia.
c. No live or attenuated-live vaccines for patients with impaired T-/B-lymphocyte function. Otherwise follow usual vaccination schedule.
d. If fever >38.4°C, seek emergent care for CBC, blood culture, and empiric antibiotics.
e. Children with mild-moderate neutropenia can attend school/daycare, if they avoid obviously ill children.



CAUSES OF NEUTROPENIA
Cause	Mechanism	Presentation


Infections	Viruses (EBV, CMV, parvovirus, HHV6, HIV, viral hepatitis).
Bacteria (typhoid fever, Brucellosis).
Protozoa (Leishmania, malaria), Rickettsial infections, etc.
Medications	Many: sulfasalazine, antipsychotics (clozapine, phenothiazines), thionamides, antimicrobials (TMP/SMX).

Bone marrow suppression, viral-induced immune neutropenia, redistribution to marginated pools.


Direct marrow suppression (more common) or drug-induced immune-mediated destruction.

Occurs early in illness, persists 3-8 days and resolves spontaneously and/or with effective treatment of underlying illness.


Hypersensitivity reaction: fever, lymphadenopathy, rash. May have +ANA.

Nutritional	Vitamin B12 deficiency	Ineffective hematopoiesis due to impaired DNA	Mostly seen in chronically ill children, especially with

Folic acid deficiency Copper deficiency

processing and nuclear maturation (with B12/ folate deficiency).

malabsorption.
Hypersegmented neutrophils, megaloblastic anemia with B12/folate deficiency.
High MMA and HcY in B12 deficiency vs. high HcY in folate deficiency.

CAUSES OF NEUTROPENIA-cont'd.
Cause	Mechanism	Presentation

Autoimmune	Neonatal alloimmune neutropenia	Transfer of maternal IgG alloantibodies against
fetus neutrophil antigens that were produced in response to fetal cells in maternal circulation.
Primary autoimmune neutropenia	Antineutrophil antibodies cross-react with
antigen on neutrophil surface resulting in neutrophil destruction.
Secondary autoimmune neutropenia	Secondary to systemic disease: Systemic lupus
erythematosus, Evans syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis/Felty syndrome, systemic sclerosis), infections (HIV, EBV).
Pure white cell aplasia	Associated with thymoma, drug reactions, antiglomerular basement membrane antibody disease.

Severe neutropenia with fever, infection. Transient, resolves after 6-8 weeks.

Typically 5-15 months old child without recurrent infections despite severe neutropenia. +ANA. Marrow with myeloid hyperplasia and normal to increased mature neutrophils.
Presents with signs/symptoms of systemic autoimmune disease.


At risk of severe, recurrent infections.
Disappearance of granulocytopoietic tissue from bone marrow. +Antibodies (e.g., GM- CFU inhibitory activity).



INHERITEDa
Severe congenital neutropenia


Severe congenital neutropenia	AD mutation in ELANE or GFII genes results in rapid apoptosis of myeloid precursors, arrest at promyelocyte development stage.
Risk of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia.
Kostmann syndrome	Severe form of SCN. AR mutation in HAX1 gene results in absent myeloid progenitors.


Recurrent infections: mouth ulcers, gingivitis, otitis media, respiratory infections, skin cellulitis, abscesses.
Often with oncocytosis, eosinophilia, anemia, thrombocytosis.
Bone marrow: myeloid maturation arrest, normal/increased promyelocytes.
Recurrent infections as above. Typically with monocytosis, eosinophilia.

Cyclic neutropenia	AD mutation in ELANE gene.	Periodic ~21-day cycles of neutropenia, typically associated with fever, oral ulcerations, +/- gingivitis, pharyngitis, skin infections.

 III. THROMBOCYTOPENIA AND IMPAIRED PLATELET FUNCTION	
A. Definition of Thrombocytopenia
1. Defined as platelet count <150,000/µL.
2. See Table 14.1 for age-specific values.
B. Bleeding Risk with Thrombocytopenia
1. Risk of clinically significant bleeding is related to both platelet function and number. Unlikely with platelet counts >30,000/µL in the absence of other complicating factors.14
2. Risk of severe bleeding (CNS hemorrhage, gross hematuria, melena/hema- tochezia, hematemesis) increases with platelet counts <10,000/µL.14
C. Evaluation of Thrombocytopenia15,16
1. Platelet size: Large = mean platelet volume (MPV) >11 fL, normal = MPV 7 to 11 fL, small = MPV <7 fL.
a. Large platelets suggest increased marrow production in destructive processes (e.g., immune thrombocytopenia [ITP]) or some congeni- tal disorders.
b. Small platelets suggest production defects, typically seen in congeni- tal disorders.
2. Peripheral blood smear: Confirm platelet count, evaluate size and mor- phology, and rule out artifact platelet aggregation (i.e., due to artificial clumping in EDTA tube).
3. Immature platelet fraction: Correlates with measure of reticulated plate- lets, which reflects thrombopoiesis. Increases with peripheral destruc- tion; is normal/low with bone marrow failure.
4. Bone marrow aspiration: Obtain if systemic symptoms concerning for underlying malignancy, involvement other cell lines, and/or blasts on smear. Differentiates decreased production versus increased destruction.
D. Causes of Thrombocytopenia and Impaired Platelet Function
1. See Table 14.9 for an approach to the differential of thrombocytopenia.
2. See Table 14.10 for differential of abnormal platelet function.
E. Management of Thrombocytopenia
1. ITP17
a. Pathophysiology: Immune-mediated destruction of circulating platelets.
b. Presentation: Otherwise healthy 2- to 10-year-old child with sudden bruising or bleeding after recent mild illness or vaccination, isolated thrombocytopenia (platelets <100,000/µL), and peripheral smear with thrombocytopenia and reticulated large platelets.
c. Diagnostic testing: No additional testing needed if presentation consistent with ITP. If persists >3 to 6 months, pursue further workup: Infection testing (human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C, Helicobacter pylori infection), antinuclear antibody, anticardiolipin

antibody and lupus anticoagulant (for antiphospholipid syndrome), serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM).18
d. Management: Observation if no or mild bleeding (e.g., skin manifes- tations). Treat if significant skin/mucosal bleeding with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), steroids, or Anti-Rh (D) immune globulin
in consultation with a hematologist.18 Only transfuse platelets if life-threatening bleed, often with IVIG and high-dose steroids. May require emergent splenectomy.
2. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)19
a. Pathophysiology: Decreased ADAMTS13 activity results in impaired processing of von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimers, which causes microthrombi.
b. Presentation: Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), throm- bocytopenia, acute kidney injury, fever, and neurologic symptoms (headache, hemiparesis, coma).
c. Management: Early plasma exchange with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and glucocorticoids. If high clinical suspicion, treat emergently before ADAMTS13 testing results.
3. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS)
a. Pathophysiology: Due to Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 or Shigella diarrhea (sometimes Streptococcus pneu- moniae, HIV).20
b. Presentation: Early abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, late throm- bocytopenia and renal failure.
c. Management: Supportive care with early/aggressive hydration, RBC/ platelet transfusions as needed, antihypertensives, and neurologic monitoring.21
4. Complement-mediated ("Atypical HUS")
a. Pathophysiology: Uncontrolled activation of complement on cell membranes.21
b. Diagnostic testing: Complement panel, anti-CFH antibodies, consider genetic screening.
c. Management: Eculizumab.

5. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia22
a. Presentation: Lightheadedness, chills, fever, nausea/vomiting, pur- pura, petechiae ~7 days after starting medication (onset variable).
b. Diagnostic testing for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: +anti-PF4/ heparin antibodies, +serotonin release assay.
c. Management: Discontinue medication permanently, transfuse if severe thrombocytopenia to prevent intracranial or intrapulmonary hemorrhage.
6. Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia23
a. Pathophysiology: Maternal IgG antibodies (usually against paternally inherited PLA-1/HPA-1a) cross placenta and cause neonatal platelet destruction.
b. Presentation: Severe thrombocytopenia, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).
c. Diagnostic testing: Identify antipaternal antibodies in infant circula- tion or maternal and infant platelet antigen typing.
d. Management: Head ultrasound (US) to screen for ICH, transfuse platelets if <30,000/µL or signs of bleeding, consider IVIG if poor response to platelet transfusion.

 IV. COAGULATION	
A. Evaluation of Coagulation and Platelet Function
1. Coagulation
a. See Fig. 14.3 for coagulation cascade.
b. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT): Measures intrinsic sys- tem and common pathway-Factors V, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, fibrinogen, and prothrombin.
c. Prothrombin time (PT): Measures extrinsic pathway and common pathway-Factors V, VII, X, fibrinogen, and prothrombin.
d. Thrombin time (TT): Measures conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Prolonged with low or dysfunctional fibrinogen and anticoagulants (heparin, low molecular weight heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors), but not with common pathway abnormalities.
e. Reptilase time (RT): Normal with heparin or direct thrombin inhibi- tors, but prolonged with fibrinogen abnormalities.
f. Mixing study: Used in patients with abnormal clotting (i.e., prolonged PT, aPTT, or TT) to determine presence of factor deficiency (corrects with addition of normal plasma) or factor inhibitor (no correction would occur).
g. Dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT): Russell viper activates factor X directly and is sensitive to inhibition by antiphospholipid antibod- ies. Prolonged dRVVT that corrects with addition of phospholipid
to assay suggests presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (Lupus anticoagulants).24

(Adapted from Rodriguez V. and Warad D, Pediatric coagulation disorders. Pediatr Rev. 2016:37[7]:279-290. Adaptation cour- tesy James Casella and Clifford Takemoto.)

h. Fibrinogen: Low levels (<50 to 100 mg/dL) causes impaired clot formation and prolongs PT and aPTT. Decreased in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), liver disease, traumatic hemorrhage.
i. D-dimer: Fibrin degradation product increased with recent/ongoing fibrinolysis (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, DIC, and many other clinical scenarios).
j. Thromboelastography (TEG): Whole blood test that rapidly measures time parameters of clot formation and overall clot strength, detects increased fibrinolysis. Useful for identification of coagulopathy and to guide transfusion in cardiac surgery and trauma.25
2. Platelet function12
a. Always assess platelet number and use of platelet inhibitors (e.g., nonste- roidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) before platelet function testing.
b. Light transmission aggregometry (LTA): Measures platelet aggregation
in vitro.16
c. Platelet function analyzer-100 (PFA-100): Measures primary hemo- stasis (platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation) in vitro.16
d. Bleeding time (BT): Evaluates clot formation, including platelet num- ber/function and vWF, in vivo. Technically challenging to perform and has been largely replaced by above tests.
B. Definition of Abnormal Coagulation
1. An incorrect anticoagulant-to-blood ratio will give inaccurate results.
2. See Table 14.11 at end of chapter which lists normal hematologic values for coagulation testing.
C. Causes and Management of Coagulopathy
1. Medications
a. Heparin affects aPTT, thrombin time, dRVVT, and mixing studies.
b. Warfarin affects PT, may mildly affect aPTT, and interferes with dRVVT by reducing the activity of vitamin K-dependent factors (II, VII, IX, X, protein C and S).
2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation
a. Tissue damage (e.g., due to sepsis, trauma, malignancy) results in tissue factor release and systemic activation of coagulation system, consumption of coagulation factors and platelets, increased fibrin formation and fibrinolysis, MAHA, bleeding, and microthromboses.26
b. Diagnosis: Prolonged P T and aPTT, decreased fibrinogen, thrombo- cytopenia, increased D-Dimer, increased fibrin degradation products, and presence of schistocytes on peripheral smear.
c. Treatment: Address underlying condition and supportive care. May require FFP, cryoprecipitate, and/or platelet transfusions if active bleeding or high bleeding risk.
3. Liver disease
a. The liver is the major site of synthesis of factors V, VII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII.
b. It is also involved in the synthesis of prothrombin, plasminogen, fibrinogen, proteins C and S, and ATIII.

4. Vitamin K deficiency
a. Often secondary to liver disease, pancreatic insufficiency, malabsorp- tion, exclusive breastfeeding, prolonged antibiotic use, malignancy.
b. Necessary for synthesis of factors II, VII, IX, X, protein C, and protein S.12
c. Treatment: Parenteral vitamin K corrects PT in 2 to 6 hours. Oral form corrects in 6-8 hours.27 Give FFP if evidence of severe bleed- ing. Prothrombin complex concentrate can be given in cases of life-threatening hemorrhage or ICH.
5. Hemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency) and Hemophilia B (Factor IX deficiency)28
a. Etiology: X-linked recessive disorders. Females can be symptomatic carriers.
b. Diagnosis: Prolonged aPTT that corrects with mixing study, normal PT, low factor assays. Mild forms can have normal aPTT.
c. Classification of disease severity:28
(1) Severe: <1% activity; spontaneous bleed (hemarthrosis, hema- toma) without trauma.
(2) Moderate: 1% to 5% activity; bleeding after minor trauma.
(3) Mild: 5% to 40% activity; bleeding with surgery or significant trauma.
d. Bleeding prophylaxis:
(1) Home prophylaxis: Intravenous (IV) factor replacement (per individualized protocols) to maintain factor level >1 IU/dL to prevent spontaneous bleeds and preserve joint function. Initiate before onset of frequent bleeding, typically in 1- to 3-year-olds.29 Emicizumab-kxwh is a bispecific antibody that is delivered sub- cutaneously (SQ) and can be used for prophylaxis.
(2) Surgical prophylaxis: Factor replacement for goal factor level 80 to 100 IU/dL (major procedure) or 50 to 80 IU/dL (minor procedure) preoperatively and through postoperative period of bleeding risk.28 Consult hematologist before any diagnostic or
therapeutic procedure, including dental, endoscopy with biopsy, arterial blood gas, etc.
e. Treatment of acute bleeds:
(1) Always remember: "Factor first!" Do not delay first dose for evaluation.
(2) Bolus dose FVIII or FVIX concentrate. May require additional doses.
(3) Consult hematologist for all major bleeding.
(4) See Table 14.12 for desired factor replacement level and dosing.
(5) Half-life of Factor VIII: 8 to 12 hours. Half-life Factor IX: 18 to 24 hours.28
(6) If suspected intracranial bleed, replete 100% factor level imme- diately on presentation and before additional diagnostic testing (e.g., CT scan).

Bleeding SiteDesired Level (%)Minor soft tissue bleeding20-30Joint40-70Simple dental extraction50Major soft tissue bleeding80-100Serious oral bleeding80-100Head injury100+Major surgery (dental, orthopedic, other)100+NOTE: A hematologist should be consulted for all major bleeding and before surgery. Round to the nearest vial; do not exceed 200%.
Dose calculation:
1. Units of factor VIII needed = weight (kg) × desired % replacement × 0.5.
2. Units of factor IX needed = weight (kg) × desired % replacement × 1.0 or 1.2.
Dosing adapted from Nathan D, Oski FA. Hematology of Infancy and Childhood. Philadelphia: WB Saunders; 1998.

(8) Can use cryoprecipitate (for Hemophilia A, not for Hemophilia B) or FFP if no factor available.
f. Factor inhibitors: IgG antibodies that develop with repeat factor exposure and complicate treatment. Patients with severe hemophilia A are at the highest risk.
(1) Screen for inhibitors with inhibitor assay if poor clinical response to factor. Consider screen during initiation of factor treatment and preoperatively.
(2) In the presence of inhibitors, patients may require higher doses of factor, recombinant FVIIa, or activated prothrombin complex concentrates.
g. Healthcare maintenance
(1) Vaccinations: Given per routine schedule. Give prophylactic fac- tor for intramuscular vaccines or give vaccine SQ with smallest gauge needle without factor prophylaxis.28
(2) Physical activity: Avoid high contact (e.g., soccer, hockey) and high velocity (e.g., skiing) activities.28
(3) Medications to avoid: Aspirin, NSAIDs, anticoagulants.
(4) Many younger children will need a central venous catheter for factor delivery and must therefore follow strict fever guidelines.
6. Von Willebrand (vW) disease
a. Pathophysiology: Most common inherited bleeding disorder.
Abnormal platelet adhesion and aggregation, low factor VIII.30
b. Diagnosis: Low circulating vWF antigen (VWF:Ag) and/or low vWF function on ristocetin-based platelet aggregation study (VWF:RCo), low or normal factor VIII activity, prolonged PFA-100. May require additional evaluation.
c. Classification:30
(1) Type 1 (75% to 80% cases): Partial quantitative deficiency.
(2) Type 2 (20% to 25%): Qualitative dysfunction.

(3) Type 3 (rare): Absence or near absence of vWF + markedly low factor VIII activity (can resemble Hemophilia A patient on labs and presentation).
d. Treatment:30
(1) Desmopressin (DDAVP): Stimulates vWF release. Given IV or intranasal. May be used as prophylaxis for minor surgeries or treatment for mild bleeding. Ineffective in Type 3, variable effect in Type 2. Patients should be tested for DDAVP response before using as prophylaxis.
(2) VWF-containing concentrates (Humate-P, Alphanate, or Wilate): Replaces vWF and factor VIII and derived from blood donors. Recombinant vWF available (VONVENDI). Used for severe bleeding events and surgery.
(3) Cryoprecipitate only appropriate for life-threatening situations if vWF concentrate unavailable.
(4) Alternative therapies: IV or oral antifibrinolytic therapy (tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid) can be used to prevent or treat mild mucocutaneous bleeding alone or in conjunction with other therapies.
D. Causes of Hypercoagulability
1. Most thrombotic events are due to an acquired condition; however, an inherited thrombophilia is more likely if there is a family history, an
unusual thrombus location, absence of an inciting factor, and/or recur- rent thromboses.
2. See Table 14.13 for etiologies and evaluation of hypercoagulable states.
3. Acquired conditions associated with venous thromboembolism include endothelial damage (vascular catheters, sepsis, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, surgery, hyperlipidemia), disturbed blood flow (central venous lines, congenital heart disease), hyperviscos- ity (macroglobulinemia, polycythemia, sickle cell disease), platelet activation (essential thrombocytosis, oral contraceptives, heparin-
induced thrombocytopenia), malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease, parenteral nutrition, nephrotic syndrome, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.
E. Thrombus Management
1. See Table 14.14 for anticoagulant use.
2. See Formulary for dosing and adjustment based on monitoring protocols.
3. Note: Children receiving anticoagulation therapy should be protected from trauma. Subcutaneous injections should be used when possible, and caution should be used with intramuscular injections. The use of antiplatelet agents and arterial punctures should be avoided.
4. See Table 14.15 for warfarin reversal guidelines.

Hold warfarin.
Recheck INR every 12 hr.
Give high dose oral vitamin K every 12-24 hr as necessaryb.
When INR approaches therapeutic range, resume warfarin at a lower dose.
Hold warfarin.
Monitor INR every 12-24 hr depending on bleeding severity.
Give standard dose oral vitamin K and repeat as necessary if bleeding continues and INR not corrected at 24 hra.
Restart warfarin when INR approaches therapeutic range and when clinically appropriate at a lower dose.
Hold warfarin.
Monitor INR every 4-6 hr.
Administer high dose vitamin K IV, repeat as neededb.
Transfusion of FFP (10-15 mL/kg IV), consider prothrombin complex concentrate; consult blood bank and/or hematology for dosing.
Restart warfarin when INR approaches therapeutic range and when clinically appropriate at a lower dose.

aStandard dose Vitamin K: 0.03 mg/kg PO for patients <40 kg in weight; 1-2.5 mg PO for patients ?40 kg. For rapid reversal, 0.5-2.5 mg IV slow infusion over 30 minutes. Expect INR reduction at 24-48 hr.
bHigh dose Vitamin K: 0.06 mg/kg PO for patients <40 kg in weight; 5-10 mg for patients ?40 kg. For emergent situa-
tions, 5-10 mg IV slow infusion over 30 minutes. Expect INR reduction at 12-14 hr.
NOTE: Always evaluate for bleeding risks and potential drug interactions. Do not give intramuscular Vitamin K to children on anticoagulants.

 VII. ONLINE CONTENT	
A. Specific PRBC Types
1. Leukoreduced RBCs: 99.9% white blood cells (WBCs) removed to reduce risks of pathogen transmission (e.g., CMV), HLA alloimmuniza- tion and febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction.
2. Washed RBCs: Removal of plasma proteins in products for recipients with history of anaphylactic transfusions reactions or complete IgA deficiency.
3. CMV-safe RBCs: Leukoreduced units likely comparable to low transmis- sion risk with CMV-seronegative units (from donors with negative CMV serology). Preferred for vulnerable populations: CMV-negative bone marrow transplant or solid organ recipients, immunodeficient patients, premature or low birth weight infants, intrauterine transfusions, preg- nant women.
4. Irradiated blood products: Inactivated donor lymphocytes capable of causing transfusion-associated graft versus host disease (GVHD).33 Used for susceptible patients: leukemia, lymphoma, BMT, solid organ transplant, intensive chemotherapy, known/suspected immune defi- ciency, intrauterine transfusions, neonate transfusions, patients receiv- ing T-cell suppressive therapy. Also necessary in directed donation from a relative.
B. Directed Donor Transfusions
1. When to consider directed donor:
a. Chronic transfusion programs (e.g., "blood buddy" programs), where donors provide antigen-matched red cells repetitively for the same patient requiring frequent transfusions (e.g., thalassemia, sickle cell disease).
b. NAIT, where maternal platelets lack causative antigens and represent optimal therapy.
2. Reasons to not consider directed donor:
a. Practice not often feasible. Specific screening, donation, product testing, and processing causes delays (2 to 3 days or more) when compatible blood is often readily available.
b. Directed donor may not be compatible: must be at least ABO/RhD compatible, and may require other RBC antigen compatibility if recipient has antibodies.
c. Directed donors less likely to be truthful in donor screening, causing potential increased infection risk.
d. Products from a relative require irradiation for increased risk of transfusion-related graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
e. If RBC donor is also a potential bone marrow transplant donor for recipient, donation increases risk of development of donor-directed human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies in recipient, which may cause graft failure.

 I. ALLERGIC RHINITIS1-6	
A. Epidemiology
1. Most common pediatric chronic medical condition: Prevalence in chil- dren up to 40%.
2. Increases risk for recurrent otitis media, asthma, and acute and chronic sinusitis.
3. Risk factors: Atopic family history, serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E >100 IU/mL before age 6 years, higher socioeconomic status, and infant exposure to maternal smoking in utero and during early childhood.
B. Diagnosis
1. History:
a. Allergen-driven mucosal inflammation leading to cyclical exacerba- tions or persistent symptoms.
b. Symptoms: Nasal (congestion, rhinorrhea, and pruritus), ocular (pruritus and tearing), and postnasal drip (sore throat and cough).
c. Patterns: Seasonal (depending on local allergens) versus perennial (with seasonal peaks)
d. Coexisting atopic diseases common (eczema, asthma, and food allergy).
2. Physical examination:
a. Allergic facies with shiners, mouth breathing, transverse nasal crease ("allergic salute"), and accentuated lines below lower eyelids (Dennie-Morgan lines).
b. May have swollen nasal turbinates.
c. Injected sclera with or without clear discharge, conjunctival cobblestoning.
3. Diagnostic studies:
a. Diagnosis can be made on clinical grounds, however allergy with skin tests or allergen-specific IgE testing can identify specific allergic sensitivities.
b. Total IgE, peripheral blood eosinophil count and imaging studies are not recommended due to poor specificity.
C. Differential Diagnosis
Vasomotor/nonallergic rhinitis (hypersensitivity to scents, alcohol, or changes in climate), infectious rhinitis, adenoid hypertrophy, rhinitis medi- camentosa (rebound rhinitis from prolonged use of nasal vasoconstrictors), sinusitis, nonallergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome, and nasal polyps.

D. Treatment
1. Allergen avoidance:
a. Relies on identification of triggers, most common of which are pol- lens, fungi, dust mites, insects, and animals.
b. HEPA filter may be useful when animal allergens are a concern.
c. Thorough housecleaning and allergy-proof bed coverings can be useful.
2. Oral antihistamines:
a. First-line treatment for mild or episodic symptoms or young patients who cannot tolerate or refuse nasal sprays.
b. Second- and third-generation preparations preferable (loratadine, desloratadine, fexofenadine, cetirizine, and levocetirizine) due to reduced central nervous system (CNS) side effects.
c. Adverse effects: Sedation and anticholinergic side effects (more prominent with first-generation agents).
3. Intranasal corticosteroids (fluticasone, mometasone, budesonide, fluni- solide, ciclesonide, and triamcinolone):
a. First-line for persistent or moderate-to-severe symptoms, as it is the most effective single maintenance therapy for nasal congestion and reduction of ocular symptoms.
b. Maximal therapeutic benefit when used over several days or weeks. No effect with as-needed use.
c. Adverse effects: Nasal irritation, sneezing, bleeding, and potential risk of reduction in growth velocity and adrenal suppression at high doses, especially in patients on multiple steroid preparations. Growth monitoring recommended.
d. Administration: Clear mucus crusting, keep head pointed slightly down and avoid pointing medication at nasal septum.
4. Leukotriene inhibitors (montelukast):
a. More effective in combination with antihistamines.
b. Consider in patients with concomitant asthma.
5. Intranasal antihistamines (azelastine and olopatadine):
a. Effective for acute symptoms; faster onset of action than glucocorti- coid nasal spray.
b. Adverse effects: Bitter taste, systemic absorption with potential for sedation.
6. Intranasal combination agents (azelastine/fluticasone): Useful for patients with moderate-to-severe allergic rhinitis.
7. Immunotherapy:
a. Success rate is high when patients are chosen carefully and when performed by an allergy specialist.
b. Consider when symptoms are inadequately controlled with medica- tions and allergen avoidance.
c. In addition to traditional subcutaneous immunotherapy, sublingual products have now been approved for several allergens.
d. Not recommended for patients with poor adherence to therapy or those with poorly controlled asthma.


e. Not well studied in children younger than 5 years.
f. May reduce risk for future development of asthma, and treatment of allergic rhinitis may improve asthma control.
8. Nasal irrigation with hypertonic saline: Use distilled, sterile, or boiled water (at least 3 minutes) for homemade solutions.
9. Ophthalmic agents: Can be used to treat allergic conjunctivitis. Up to 60% of patients with allergic rhinitis have concomitant conjunc- tivitis. Avoid the use of steroids unless under the direction of an ophthalmologist.
a. Mast cell stabilizers: Cromolyn sodium, lodoxamide-tromethamine, nedocromil, and pemirolast.
b. H1-antagonists and mast cell stabilizers: Alcaftadine, azelastine HCl, bepotastine, emedastine, epinastine, ketotifen fumarate, and olopatadine.

 II. FOOD ALLERGY7-12	
A. Epidemiology
1. Prevalence is 6% to 8% in young children and 3% to 4% in adolescence.
2. Most common allergens in children: Milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts (e.g., cashew, walnut), soy, fish, shellfish, and wheat.
B. Manifestations of Food Allergy
1. Often a combination of several syndromes; symptoms can occur within minutes to hours of ingesting food.
2. Diagnosis requires both sensitization (demonstration of allergen-specific IgE) and clinical symptoms after exposure to allergens.
3. Anaphylaxis: See Chapter 1.
4. Skin syndromes:
a. Urticaria/angioedema:
(1) Chronic urticaria is rarely related to food allergy.
(2) Acute urticaria due to food allergy may be a risk factor for future anaphylaxis.
b. Atopic dermatitis/eczema:
(1) Food allergy is more common in patients with atopic dermatitis.
(2) Even if not apparent by history, at least one-third of children with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis have IgE-mediated food allergies.
5. Gastrointestinal syndromes:
a. Oral allergy syndrome:
(1) Pollen-associated food allergy caused by cross-reactivity of anti- bodies to pollens (e.g., apple and tree pollen).
(2) Pruritus of oral mucosa after ingestion of certain fresh fruits and vegetables in patients with pollen allergies. Rarely results in edema of oral mucosa, or progresses beyond mouth/throat.
(3) Inciting antigens are usually denatured by cooking.


b. Allergic eosinophilic gastroenteritis, esophagitis: see Chapter 12
c. Food protein induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES):
(1) Presents in infancy.
(2) Vomiting and diarrhea (may contain blood); when severe, may lead to lethargy, dehydration, hypotension, acidosis.
(3) Most commonly associated with milk and soy, but may occur with a wide variety of foods (e.g., rice, oat, fruits, and vegetables).
d. Infantile proctocolitis:
(1) Confined to distal colon and can present with diarrhea or blood- streaked and mucous-containing stools.
(2) Symptoms usually resolve within 72 hours of stopping offending agent; rarely leads to anemia.
C. Diagnosis of Food Allergy (Fig. 15.1)
1. History and physical examination:
a. Identify specific foods and whether fresh vs. cooked.
b. Establish timing and nature of reactions.
2. Skin testing:
a. Skin prick test has poor positive predictive value, but very good nega- tive predictive value.
b. Patient must not be taking antihistamines.
c. Widespread skin conditions (e.g., dermatographism, urticaria, severe eczema) may limit ability to perform skin tests.
3. Measurement of allergen-specific IgE:
a. Similar to skin tests, it has poor positive predictive value and excel- lent negative predictive value.
b. Levels above a certain range (variable amongst different antigens) have increasing positive predictive value.
c. Useful in patients with dermatologic conditions that preclude skin testing.
d. Component testing (measuring IgE to specific food proteins rather than crude extracts) may improve diagnostic accuracy for peanut and possibly other foods.
4. Oral food challenges:
a. Can verify clinical reactivity to a specific food allergen or document that a food allergy has been outgrown.
b. Must be performed under close medical supervision with emergency medications readily available.
c. Patient must not be taking antihistamines.
d. Most accurate when double-blinded using graded doses of disguised food.
5. Trial elimination diet:
a. Helpful if improvement with removal of food from diet.
b. Essential, especially in infants and for non-IgE-mediated food allergy.

2. Malabsorption syndromes:
a. Cystic fibrosis, celiac disease (see Chapter 12), and lactase deficiency.
b. Gastrointestinal malformations.


E. Treatment
1. Allergen avoidance:
a. Most important intervention for all types of food allergy.
b. Patients must pay close attention to food ingredients. Implement an "If you can't read it, you can't eat it" approach to avoid risky unla- beled foods.
c. Nutritional counseling and regular growth monitoring are recommended.
2. Nonanaphylactic angioedema/urticaria:
a. Antihistamines or corticosteroids, based on severity and duration of symptoms.
b. Omalizumab used for chronic urticaria.
3. Atopic dermatitis: Symptomatic control (see Chapter 8).
4. Anaphylaxis:
a. See Chapter 1 for management of anaphylaxis.
b. Prescribe epinephrine auto-injector for all at-risk patients. Counsel to call 9-1-1 if using.
c. Develop Anaphylaxis Action Plan indicating specific allergies, symp- toms for which to observe, and medications to be administered.
d. Counsel families to always have epinephrine auto-injector readily available.
e. Make school aware of Anaphylaxis Action Plan and ensure they can administer lifesaving medications.
5. Food-specific immunotherapy is under investigation. It is used to induce clinical desensitization to specific allergens.
F. Natural History
1. About 50% of milk, egg, soy, and wheat allergies are outgrown by school age.
2. Peanut, tree nut, and shellfish allergies are outgrown only in 10% to 20%.
3. Skin tests and allergen-specific IgE may remain positive, even though symptoms resolve.

 III. DRUG ALLERGY13,14	
A. Definition
1. Drug allergy: Immunologically mediated response to an agent in a sensi- tized person.
2. Drug intolerance: Undesirable pharmacologic effect.
3. Although 10% of patients report penicillin allergy, after evaluation, about 90% of these individuals can tolerate penicillin.
B. Diagnosis
1. Cutaneous manifestations are the most common presentation for drug allergic reactions.
2. Diagnostic studies: Penicillin is the only drug for which standardized skin testing reagents and procedures have been validated. Skin testing or supervised graded dose challenge may be done with caution for other


medications, but the results must be carefully considered in the context of the clinical pictures, as both false positive and false negative results are common.
C. Management (Fig. 15.2)
1. Avoidance: When able, utilize alternative therapy.
2. Desensitization: Progressive administration of an allergenic substance to render immune system less reactive.

3. Graded challenge: Administration of progressively increasing doses of a drug until full dose is reached; does not modify a patient's response to the drug, but is used to optimize safety when the history and test results are not completely reassuring.

See Tables 15.1 and 15.2.15-21

A. Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG)
1. Indications:
a. Replacement therapy for antibody-deficient disorders:
(1) Children with severe hypogammaglobulinemia (<100 mg/dL) may benefit from a higher total loading dose in two separate doses a few days apart, followed by standard dosing every 3 to 4 weeks.
(2) Useful in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), antibody deficiency (IgG concentration <400 mg/dL from failure to form antibodies to common antigens), recurrent serious bacterial infections, or prior to measles prophylaxis.

b. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (see Chapter 14):
(1) Initially given on a single day or in divided doses over 2 to 5 consecutive days.
(2) Maintenance dose given every 3 to 6 weeks based on clinical response and platelet count.
c. Bone marrow transplantation:
(1) Adjust dosing to maintain trough IgG level of at least 400 mg/dL.
(2) May decrease incidence of infection and death but not acute graft-versus-host disease.
d. Other indications:
(1) Kawasaki disease (see Chapter 7).
(2) Guillain-Barré syndrome.
(3) Refractory dermatomyositis and polymyositis.
(4) Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.
2. Precautions and adverse reactions:
a. Severe systemic symptoms (hemodynamic changes, respiratory dif- ficulty, and anaphylaxis).
b. Less-severe systemic reactions (headache, myalgia, fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting).
(1) Decrease infusion rate and/or premedicate with intravenous corticosteroids, and/or antipyretics.
(2) Can progress to aseptic meningitis syndrome.
c. Acute renal failure (increased risk with preexisting renal insufficiency and with sucrose-containing IVIG).
d. Acute venous thrombosis (increased risk with sucrose-containing IVIG).
e. Use with caution in patients with confirmed undetectable IgA levels (e.g., patients with partial B-cell immunodeficiencies or familial
IgA deficiency), as antibodies against IgA may trigger anaphylactic reaction.
B. Intramuscular Immunoglobulin (IMIG)
1. Prophylaxis Indications: Hepatitis A, measles, rubella, rabies, and varicella-zoster (see Chapter 16).
2. Precautions and adverse reactions:
a. Similar to IVIG (discussed previously).
b. Local reaction at injection site increases with repeated use.
c. Intravenous or intradermal use of IMIG is absolutely contraindicated due to high risk for anaphylactoid reactions.
3. Administration:
a. No more than 5 mL should be given at one site in large child/adoles- cent, and 1 to 3 mL for smaller children/infants.
b. Administration of greater than 15 mL at one time is essentially never warranted.
c. Peak serum levels achieved by 48 hours; immune effect lasts 3 to 4 weeks.

378	Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information

C. Subcutaneous Immunoglobulin
1. Indication: Replacement therapy for antibody deficiency.
2. Dose:
a. See the Formulary for dosages and administration instructions.
b. Larger doses can be given simultaneously in multiple sites or more frequently than once weekly.
c. Using the same areas for injections improves tolerability.
3. Precautions and adverse reactions:
a. Systemic side effects are rare because of the small volumes given and the slow absorption rate.
b. Local redness and swelling are expected and generally decrease with every infusion.
4. Considerations: Does not require venous access or special nursing (par- ents can administer), but may require multiple needlesticks in larger children, depending on the volume to be infused.
D. Specific Immunoglobulins
1. Hyperimmune globulins:
a. Prepared from donors with high titers of specific antibodies.
b. Includes hepatitis B immune globulin, varicella-zoster immune globulin, cytomegalovirus immune globulin, Rho(D) immune globu- lin, botulism immune globulin, and others.
2. Monoclonal antibody preparations (rituximab, palivizumab, and others).

3. Combination vaccines can reduce number of injections.
a. MMR-Varicella (ProQuad)4 can be used for children 12 months through 12 years of age. There is an increased risk of febrile seizures if given as first dose for ages 12 to 47 months.
b. HepB-containing5 combination vaccines should not be administered to infants <6 weeks because of the other components.
4. Simultaneous administration
a. Routine childhood vaccines are safe and effective when adminis- tered simultaneously at different sites. There is no maximum number of vaccines that can be coadministered.
b. If live vaccines are not given at the same visit, they should be sepa- rated by an interval of 28 days.
C. Live, Attenuated Vaccines
1. Certain vaccines have live components that must replicate to produce immunity: Influenza (intranasal), MMR, oral polio vaccine (OPV), BCG, typhoid (oral), varicella, yellow fever.
2. Systemic adverse reactions following these vaccines are usually mild, and usually occur 3 to 21 days after the vaccine is given.
3. Special consideration must be taken when administering these vaccines to patients with certain underlying medical conditions (see Section IV).
D. Timing and Spacing of Vaccine Doses
1. For information on recommended timing and spacing of vaccines, see: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/timing.html.
2. Combination vaccines
a. Minimum age for administration is the oldest age for any of the indi- vidual components.
b. Minimum interval between doses is equal to the greatest interval of any of the individual components.
E. Contraindications and Precautions6
1. Contraindication: A condition that increases the likelihood of a serious adverse reaction to a vaccine for a patient with that condition.
2. Precaution: A condition that may increase the likelihood or severity of an adverse reaction in a vaccine recipient, or may compromise the ability of the vaccine to produce immunity.
3. Table 16.3: Contraindications and precautions to select vaccines.
4. Table 16.4: Conditions incorrectly perceived as contraindications or pre- cautions to vaccination (vaccines may be given under these conditions).

a. See Section IV.B for Hib, meningococcal, and pneumococcal vac- cination recommendations.
b. Varicella: Administer when CD4+ =15%.
c. MMR: Give 2 doses to all HIV-infected children without evidence of severe immunosuppression (i.e., age =5 years with CD4+ =15% for
=6 months OR age >5 years with CD4+ =15% and CD4+ count =200 cells/mm for =6 months).
d. Do not give MMR-Varicella combined vaccine.
e. Do not administer LAIV.
f. Do not administer OPV and BCG unless in areas where infection risk outweighs possibility of vaccine-associated disease.
g. Consider passive immunoprophylaxis or chemoprophylaxis after exposures (see Table 16.5).
6. Malignancy
a. Always consult with the patient's oncologist first. Recommendations vary based on the patient's specific treatment regimen.
b. General strategies include the following

(2) Obtaining titers and revaccinating those with unprotective levels.
c. Timing of resumption of immunization varies based on the patient's specific treatment regimen (from 3 months to =24 months).
(1) Inactivated vaccines are generally delayed until =6 months after the end of chemotherapy.
(2) Live vaccines are generally delayed until =12 months after the end of chemotherapy.
d. Inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) should be given annually, even during chemotherapy.
7. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients
a. After transplant, HSCT recipients are considered to have lost immu- nity to all vaccines. Reimmunize against all vaccine-preventable illnesses.
(1) Inactivated vaccines are safe to administer 6 to 12 months after HSCT. Our center starts the pneumococcal series at 6 months and the remainder at 12 months.
(2) IIV may be given as early at 6 months post-HSCT. Children
=8 years should receive two doses. Do not administer LAIV. During a community outbreak, IIV may be given 3 to 4 months post-HSCT, with a second dose 4 weeks later regardless of age.
(3) Avoid live vaccines during the first 24 months post transplant.
(4) For specific vaccine recommendations, see Table EC 16.B.
b. Consider passive immunoprophylaxis or chemoprophylaxis after exposures (see Table 16.5).
c. Household contacts should receive routine immunizations. Only exception is LAIV if the HSCT recipient's level of immunocompromise is severe (e.g., HSCT in last 3 months). HSCT recipients should avoid contact with body fluids or skin eruptions of household contact who received rotavirus or varicella vaccines, respectively.
8. Solid organ transplant recipients
a. See Section IV.B.3 for pneumococcal vaccination recommendations.
b. Before transplant: Give all routinely recommended vaccines. Give live vaccines =4 weeks prior to transplantation.
(1) Children 6 to 11 months can receive MMR if not immunosup- pressed and if transplant is =4 weeks away.
(2) Children 6 to 11 months (or without evidence of varicella immu- nity) can receive varicella vaccine if not immunosuppressed and if transplant is =4 weeks away.
c. After transplant: Inactivated vaccines, including those indicated for immunocompromised hosts, should resume 2 to 6 months after transplant. Live vaccines are generally not given after transplant. For specific vaccine recommendations, see Table EC 16.C.
9. Patients on corticosteroids
a. Only live vaccines are potentially contraindicated.
b. See Table 16.6 for details.

 V. COUNSELING AND COMMUNICATION ABOUT VACCINES16-26	
A. Vaccine Hesitancy
1. Definition: Delay in the acceptance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccine services. Not a dichotomous behavior, but a con- tinuum. Vaccine-hesitant parents may accept all vaccines but remain concerned, accept some vaccines and refuse others, or refuse all vaccines. Approximately 3% of parents in the United States refuse all vaccines.20
2. The AAP recommends continued engagement with vaccine-hesitant parents while providing other health services and attempting to modify opposition to vaccines.
3. Determinants of vaccine acceptance
a. The 3C Model: Confidence, Complacency, Convenience. Key deter- minants of vaccine acceptance in global populations as determined by the World Health Organization (WHO) SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy. See Online Content for more details.
b. Parental concerns about vaccines (Box 16.1)

BOX 16.1
PARENTAL CONCERNS ABOUT VACCINES
Vaccine Safety
Too many vaccines Development of autism
Vaccine additives (thimerosal, aluminum) Overload of the immune system
Serious adverse reactions
Potential for long-term adverse events Inadequate research performed before licensure May cause pain to the child
May make the child sick
Necessity of Vaccines
Disease is more "natural" than vaccine
Parents do not believe diseases being prevented are serious Vaccine-preventable diseases have disappeared
Not all vaccines are needed Vaccines do not work
Freedom of Choice
Parents have the right to choose whether to immunize their child Parents know what's best for their child
Believe that the risks outweigh the benefits of vaccine Do not trust organized medicine, public health
Do not trust government health authorities Do not trust pharmaceutical companies Ethical, moral, or religious reasons

B. Countering Vaccine Hesitancy
1. Parent and/or patient-specific concerns should be acknowledged and addressed while correcting misconceptions in a nonconfrontational manner.
2. Relationship with primary care provider/pediatrician is a strong influ- ence on decision to vaccinate. Mutual desire to do what is best for the child should be emphasized.

B. The 3C Model: Key Barriers to Vaccine Use Worldwide16
1. Confidence: Trust in healthcare professionals, vaccines, and their effec- tiveness. Includes concerns regarding vaccine safety, quality of interac- tions with healthcare providers, religious beliefs, and media influence.
2. Complacency: Low awareness of the risks of vaccine-preventable dis- eases and the importance of vaccines. Includes resistance to introduc- tion of new vaccines, resistance to mode of vaccine delivery, and lack of knowledge about the risks of now uncommon diseases.
3. Convenience: Availability of and accessibility to vaccines and healthcare services (rural areas, low-middle income countries). Includes vaccine supply issues, lack of education or medical literacy, geographic barriers, political conflicts and instability, and immigration.
C. Strategies to Address Vaccine Hesitancy18-19,22-26
1. Communication
a. Studies have found that parents want more information than they are getting, want balanced information about potential benefits and harms, struggle to find unbiased, trustworthy sources of infor- mation, and view healthcare workers as an important source of information.
b. Consider the timing for making vaccination information available to parents, the settings where information is available, the provision of impartial and clear information tailored to parental needs, and
parents' perceptions of health workers and the information provided.
c. AAP Communication Highlights (Box EC 16.A)
2. Interventions
a. SAGE Working Group assessed systematic reviews and meta- analyses of worldwide strategies to address vaccine hesitancy. No convincing evidence that any specific intervention to address paren- tal vaccine hesitancy/refusal is effective across populations.
b. Most effective interventions were tailored to specific populations and addressing specific concerns, pointing to the importance of under- standing the drivers of vaccine hesitancy to inform the interventions.
c. Most successful interventions were multicomponent strategies that directly targeted unvaccinated/under vaccinated populations, aimed to increase vaccine knowledge and awareness, improved
convenience and access to vaccination, mandated vaccination, and engaged religious or other influential leaders to promote vaccination.


BOX EC 16.A
VACCINE COMMUNICATION HIGHLIGHTS
Vaccines are safe and effective, and serious disease can occur if your child and family are not immunized.
Vaccine-hesitant individuals are a heterogeneous group, and their individual concerns should be respected and addressed.
Vaccines are tested thoroughly before licensure, and vaccine safety assessment networks exist to monitor vaccine safety after licensure.
Nonmedical vaccine exemptions increase rates of unvaccinated children.
Unvaccinated children put vaccinated children and medically exempt children who live in that same area at risk.
Pediatricians and other healthcare providers play a major role in educating par- ents about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.
Strong provider commitment to vaccination can influence hesitant or resistant par- ents. Personalizing vaccine acceptance is often an effective approach.
The majority of parents accepted the provider's vaccine recommendations when they were presented as required immunizations to maintain optimal disease prevention.
The current vaccine schedule is the only one recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Alternative schedules have not been evaluated.

Tables 17.1-17.6 and Figs. 17.1-17.3 present the most common neonatal and pediatric infections, organized by site of infection or by organism, when applicable. These recommendations are based on national guidelines and recent literature. They are not meant to replace clinical judgment.
   For recommendations on preliminary identification of bacteria and antibiotic selection based on spectrum of activity for commonly used anti- biotics, please see Sections II-III. Please note that local resistance pattern should guide antibiotic selection. Follow published institutional guidelines and culture results for individual patients and infections. When possible, always use the agent with the narrowest spectrum of activity, particularly when organism susceptibilities are known.

1. Diagnosis
a. See Box 17.1 for screening guidelines and Box 17.2 for informa- tion on interpretation of tuberculin skin tests (TSTs) and interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs).
b. If positive screening test, obtain chest X-ray.
c. If symptoms indicate active tuberculosis (TB) disease, determine source.
(1) Consider pediatric protocol chest CT over X-ray when available.
(2) Specimen sources include sputum, bronchial washings, gastric aspirates (morning aspirate before feeding/ambulation x 3 speci- mens), pleural fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, tissue biopsy.
(3) Acid-fast smear and/or nucleic acid amplification testing may provide rapid diagnosis. The latter may also detect rifampin resis- tance. Solid media culture can take as long as 10 weeks, liquid media 1 to 6 weeks.
d. Lumbar puncture is recommended in children less than 12 months with confirmed TB and should be considered in children 12 to 24 months. (Cont'd on pg. 433.)

NEONATAL INFECTIONS
Fever in infant7,8  Serious bacterial infections (UTI, bacteremia,
meningitis) are common in febrile infants. Risk is significant even if well-appearing without a clear source.
Unimmunized infants, premature infants, or infants who received antibiotics recently are at higher risk for serious bacterial infection.

Flavivirus transmitted in utero after primary maternal infection.







0-28 days: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, GBS. Rarely, Listeria.
29+ days: The marked decline in invasive infections due to Haemophilus influenzae type b and S. pneumoniae since introduction of conjugate vaccines has reduced
the likelihood of serious bacterial infection in this age group.
In neonates under 90 days, vast majority of bacterial infections are UTIs.

Workup: RNA PCR of blood/urine, IgM in serum, and neuroimaging.
Test if:
1. Clinical findings with possible maternal infection in pregnancy based on stay in endemic areas.
2. Lab-proven maternal infection in pregnancy, even without clinical findings.

Ill-appearing infant or <28 days, require full sepsis workup and admission.
Goal with well-appearing infants >28 days is identifying those who can be safely discharged and monitored as outpatient with or without antibiotics.
Well-established algorithms often rely on the Rochester, Philadelphia, and Boston criteria. Step-by-Step approach is a newer model that
is also generally accepted. Our approach is outlined in Fig. 17.2.

Supportive. Head ultrasound, audiology evaluation, and full ophthalmologic exam by 1 month.
See Red Book and latest WHO/CDC algorithms.





Empiric therapy:
0-28 days: ampicillin + gentamicin or cefotaxime when meningitis is
suspected. Add acyclovir as clinically indicated.
29+ days: ceftriaxone
In well-appearing infants with negative cultures, treatment and admission can be shortened to 24-36 hr (blood cultures positive by 24 hr in 91% of cases of bacteremia7).

Adapted from Tunkel 2004. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid is necessary to differentiate various types of meningitis. Initial studies such as cell counts and gram stain can be helpful, but culture of cerebrospinal fluid remains diagnostic. Opening pressure is generally in the range of 200 to 500 mm H2O, although values may be lower in neonates, infants, and children with acute bacterial meningitis.



2. Treatment of latent TB infection (Cont'd from pg. 408)
a. Rule out active TB.
b. Treatment regimens
(1) 12 weeks of weekly isoniazid and rifapentine if above 2 years.
(2) 9 months of isoniazid daily.
(3) Rifampin daily for 4 months (preferred regimen if isoniazid-resistant).
c. If young (<4 years) or immunocompromised, treat recent contacts of people with active TB, even if testing (TST/IGRA) is negative. Some experts would discontinue treatment if repeat testing is negative at
8-12 weeks.
3. Treatment of active TB
a. High rates of resistance in endemic countries. Treatment should be initiated in consultation with an infectious disease specialist.

434  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information

b. Pulmonary TB: 6-month regimen, including 2 months RIPE (rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol), followed by 4 months of rifampin/isoniazid.
c. Extra-pulmonary or drug-resistant TB: Consult infectious disease specialist.
d. Pyridoxine supplementation if breastfed, meat-/milk-deficient diet, symptomatic HIV, or pregnant.
F. Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome
Please see the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines on the diagno- sis and management of children with HIV infection at www.aidsinfo.nih.gov/ for the most up-to-date recommendations.
1. Diagnosis
a. Perinatal: See Table 17.8 for diagnosis in perinatal period.37
b. Infants and children38: HIV nucleic acid testing must be used under 18 months to avoid confounding from maternal antibodies. Antigen/ antibody testing can be performed after 18 months. If concern
for breastmilk exposure, test immediately, then at 4 to 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after stopping breastfeeding.
c. Adolescents39: HIV screening with fourth-generation antigen/antibody assay with opt-out consent as part of routine clinical care. If positive, confirm with HIV-1/HIV-2 immunoassay; if indeterminate, HIV-1 nucleic acid testing.
2. Management37-40
a. See Table 17.7 for management during perinatal period.
b. Initiation of therapy for all children with HIV is recommended by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents and the World Health Organization (WHO).
c. Therapy: Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) of at least three drugs from at least two different classes. Go to http://www.aidsinfo. nih.gov/ for most current therapy recommendations.
3. Monitoring38
a. At diagnosis: CD4 count, plasma HIV RNA viral load, genotype resis- tance. If starting therapy, HLA-B*5701 (screening for hypersensitivity to abacavir) and hepatitis B serology.
b. Follow-up not on ART: Every 3 to 4 months, CD4 count, plasma HIV RNA viral load, CBC with differential, complete metabolic panel with glucose, renal function, albumin, transaminases, lipid panel. Every 6 to 12 months, obtain urinalysis to evaluate for nephropathy.
c. Follow-up on ART: At 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or switching therapy, CD4, viral load, and labs according to possible toxicities of ART. Then similar testing as above every 3 to 4 months.
d. Once viral suppression achieved, CD4 improved, good adherence, and otherwise stable for 2 to 3 years, can space labs to every 6 to 12 months.
e. Latent TB skin testing starting at age 3 to 12 months, and then annually.

(4) Some experts would consider monovalent varicella vaccine for children
>12 months with CD4 >15%. Combined MMRV should not be given.


BOX 17.2
DEFINITIONS OF POSITIVE TUBERCULIN SKIN TESTING1
Induration ?5 mm
 Children in close contact with known or suspected contagious cases of tuberculosis
 Children suspected to have tuberculosis based on clinical or radiographic findings
 Children on immunosuppressive therapy or with immunosuppressive condi- tions (including HIV infection)
Induration ?10 mm
 Children at increased risk for dissemination based on young age (<4 years) or with other medical conditions (cancer, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, or malnutrition)
 Children with increased exposure: Those born in or whose parents were born in endemic countries; those with travel to endemic countries; those exposed to HIV-infected adults, homeless persons, illicit drug users, nursing home residents, or incarcerated or institutionalized persons
Induration ?15 mm
 Children =4 years without any risk factors
A tuberculin skin testing (TST) should be read in 48 to 72 hours. The measles vaccine can suppress TST reactivity for 4 to 6 weeks. An interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) can be used instead of TST in children older than 2 years. It has a higher specificity than TST because antigens used are not found in Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine or most pathogenic nontuberculous mycobacteria.

(2) Heterosexual men and women: HIV-positive partner, bacterial STI (gonorrhea, syphilis) in past 6 months, history of incon- sistent condom use, commercial (or exchange) sex, history of high number of sex partners, living in a high HIV prevalence setting.
b. Initiating
(1) Labs: fourth generation HIV test, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, HBV, HCV (if ever used IV drugs), and renal function. Pregnancy test if indicated. Counsel on condom use.
(2) Use emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (Descovy) for biologi- cal males. Effective only after 7 days. Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (Truvada) for biological females. Effective only after 21 days. Consult infectious disease expert for initiation of PrEP unless provider has extensive experience.




DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT FOR INFANTS WITH IN UTERO HIV EXPOSURE
Age	Laboratory Testsa	Next Steps


Newborn	HIV nucleic acid test (DNA or RNA)
if maternal status unknown, or high risk of infection.
Baseline CBC with differential.










2-3 weeks	HIV nucleic acid test (DNA or RNA).
CBC with differential.

4-6 weeks	HIV nucleic acid test (DNA or RNA).
CBC with differential.

Start ZDV within 6-12 hr of delivery.
If low-risk, continue ZDV for 4 weeks.
If maternal viral load detectable and <1000 copies/mL near delivery, give nevirapine
x 3 doses (within 48hr of birth, 48hr after first dose, 96hr after second dose). Continue zidovudine for 6 weeks. Some experts add lamivudine for 1 week.
If mother did not receive antepartum ART or has acute/primary HIV in the 3rd trimester or has viral load >1000 copies/ mL near delivery, start empiric ART
with zidovudine, lamivudine, and either nevirapine or raltegravir.
Check ZDV dosing and administration.
Assess psychosocial needs, consider case management referral.
Discontinue ZDV monotherapy regardless of PCR result (ZDV monotherapy is used
during first 6 weeks for prophylaxis only). If positive, start ART according to guidelines.
Presumptively exclude HIV infection if results of =2 weeks PCR and =4 weeks PCR both negative. No TMP-SMX needed.
If PCR results not yet known, begin Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophy- laxis, such as TMP-SMX.


4-6 months	HIV nucleic acid test (DNA or RNA). Definitively exclude HIV infection: two negative
PCRs at =1 month and =4 months, as long as no signs/symptoms of HIV infection.
aAny abnormal result requires prompt pediatric HIV specialist consultation.
ART, Antiretroviral therapy; CBC, complete blood cell count; DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; IV, intravenous; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RNA, ribonucleic acid; TMP-SMX, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; ZDV, zidovudine.
Modified from Department of Health and Human Services guidelines for pediatric and perinatal HIV infection (see www. aidsinfo.nih.gov for more detailed information). National Perinatal HIV Hotline: 1-888-448-8765.

(3) Descovy and Truvada are FDA-approved for adolescents > 35kg. Descovy is not approved to prevent transmission via vaginal sex.
c. Follow-up
(1) Every 3 months: HIV test and syphilis/gonorrhea/chlamydia if patient is symptomatic, engaging in anal intercourse, has prior history of STIs, or has multiple partners. Counsel on condom use at every visit.
(2) Every 6 months: Same as above, plus routine STI screening (including oral and/or anal testing, if applicable) and renal function.
5. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)42,43
a. Indications for occupational PEP: Consider with percutaneous, mucosal, or skin exposure to blood or bodily fluids from a patient with known HIV or in whom there is high suspicion. See Section IV. for further non-HIV details.
b. Indications for nonoccupational (nPEP): Unprotected vaginal/anal intercourse, oral sex with ejaculation or blood exposure, needle shar- ing, or injuries with blood exposure from an individual with known HIV or unknown status.
c. Labs: 4th-generation HIV test, HBV surface antigen and antibody, HCV antibody. Depending on exposure, consider tetanus prophylaxis and STI testing.
d. Regimen: Initiate as soon as possible (lower likelihood of efficacy at greater than 72 hours); three-drug (or more) ART regimen for 28 days. Regimen: tenofovir and emtricitabine with raltegravir. For nPEP, dolutegravir may be used instead of raltegravir. Consult infectious disease expert for any initiation of PEP.
e. Follow-up testing can occur at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months; for occupational exposures, if 4th-generation testing available, follow-up testing can be done at 6 weeks and 4 months.
f. Clinicians' PEP Line: 1-888-448-4911.
 II. MICROBIOLOGY	
A. Collection of Specimens for Blood Culture
1. Preparation: To minimize contamination, clean venipuncture site with 70% isopropyl ethyl alcohol. Apply tincture of iodine or 10% povidone- iodine and allow skin to dry for at least 1 minute, or scrub site with 2% chlorhexidine for 30 seconds and allow skin to dry for 30 seconds. Clean blood culture bottle injection site with alcohol only.
2. Collection: Two sets of cultures from two different sites of equal blood volume should be obtained for each febrile episode, based on patient weight: less than 8 kg, 1 to 3 mL; 8 to 13 kg, 4 to 5 mL; 14 to 25 kg, 5 to 6 mL; greater than 25 kg, 10 mL. Peripheral sites preferred. If concern for central line infection, collect one from central access site, second from peripheral. Consider anaerobe blood cultures if concern for the following: head and neck infections, intra-abdominal infections, immunodeficiency, trauma or pressure sore.44,45

 III. SPECTRA OF ACTIVITY FOR COMMONLY USED ANTIBIOTICS (FIG. 17.6)	

 IV. EXPOSURES TO BLOOD BORNE PATHOGENS AND PROPHYLAXIS	
A. General Practice46
1. Regardless of status of patient, if you experience a needlestick or splash exposure, immediately wash with soap/water, irrigate, report to supervi- sor, and seek medical assistance.
2. There is an increased risk of transmission with larger volume of blood, prolonged exposure, high viral titer, deep injury, or if patient has advanced disease.
3. Source should be tested for HIV, hepatitis C antibody, and hepatitis B surface antigen. Exposed person should be tested for HIV, hepatitis C antibody, hepatitis B surface antibody, and hepatitis B surface antigen.
B. Disease-Specific Post-Exposure Management
1. Hepatitis B47: High risk of transmission if surface antigen and e-antigen positive. Lower risk of transmission if surface antigen positive, e-antigen negative. Post-exposure management includes hepatitis B immune globulin and initiation of hepatitis B vaccine series, depending on immune status. For details, see Chapter 16.
2. Hepatitis C47: Lower risk of transmission. No preventative therapy is currently recommended, but this is an evolving field. Follow-up testing essential.
3. See Section I.F for information on post-exposure management for HIV.

 I. NEWBORN RESUSCITATION	
A. Algorithm for Neonatal Resuscitation (Fig. 18.1)
1. Essential functional equipment: Radiant warmer, prewarmed blankets, hat, bag-mask/NeoPIP ventilator, appropriately sized laryngoscope, appropriately sized endotracheal tube (ETT) +/-stylet, suction device and bulb syringe, emergency medications, and vascular access supplies.
2. Meconium stained fluids: Per Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) 7th edition, routine intrapartum oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal suction- ing and endotracheal intubation are not recommended.2
3. Cord clamping should be delayed for at least 30 to 60 seconds for vigorous term and preterm infants, given no maternal or fetal indica- tions for immediate clamping.3 See Box EC 18.A for exclusions. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute use of umbilical cord milking.
B. Endotracheal Tube Size and Depth of Insertion (Table 18.1)
1. Quick estimations:
a. ETT size: 2.5 mm for infants <30 weeks gestational age (wGA); 3.0 mm for 30 to 34 wGA; 3.5 mm for >35 wGA.
b. ETT depth: Infant's weight (kg) + 6 cm
C. Vascular Access (See Chapter 4 for Umbilical Venous/Artery Catheter Placement)
NOTE: During the initial resuscitation, an umbilical venous catheter (UVC) should be inserted just far enough to obtain blood return; no measurement or verified placement is needed.
 II. ROUTINE NEWBORN CARE OF A TERM INFANT	
A. General Care for the Full-Term Healthy Newborn with Uncomplicated Delivery
NOTE: Protocols vary by hospital.
1. Drying, removal of wet blankets. Then, preferably skin-to-skin contact with mother4 or otherwise placed under warmer.
2. Feeding: Preferably breastfeeding soon after birth and on demand thereafter. Breastfed newborns should feed 8 to 12 times daily. Formula-fed newborns should be offered a bottle soon after birth.

3. Vitamin K injection for prevention of hemorrhagic disease of the newborn.
4. Antibiotic ophthalmic ointment for prophylaxis against gonococcal infection.
5. Monitor clinically for jaundice, accounting for newborn's risk factors for hyperbilirubinemia. Transcutaneous bilirubin monitoring may be useful as a screening tool but does not replace plasma level.5 Obtain plasma bilirubin level if warranted. See Section IX for more information and management.
6. Consider blood glucose monitoring if infant is at increased risk or is symptomatic of hypoglycemia (see Fig. 18.2 for management).
7. Monitor for stool/urine output. Most infants should have 1 void and 1 meconium stool within first 24 hours.6
8. Monitor for excessive weight loss.
B. Prior to Discharge7
1. Newborn metabolic screening: First screen typically performed within first 72 hours of life, at least 24 hours after initiation of feeding (see Chapter 13).
2. Vaccinations: Hepatitis B vaccine (see Chapter 16).
3. Critical congenital heart disease screening: Measure pre- and/or post- ductal oxygen saturation (see Chapter 7).
4. Newborn hearing screening.
5. Document red reflex.
6. Establish primary care.

1. Posture: Observe infant quiet and supine. Score 0 for arms, legs extended; 1 for starting to flex hips and knees, arms extended; 2 for stronger flexion of legs, arms extended; 3 for arms slightly flexed, legs flexed and abducted; and 4 for full flexion of arms and legs.
2. Square window: Flex hand on forearm enough to obtain fullest possible flexion without wrist rotation. Measure angle between hypothenar emi- nence and ventral aspect of forearm.
3. Arm recoil: With infant supine, flex forearms for 5 seconds, fully extend by pulling on hands, then release. Measure the angle of elbow flexion to which arms recoil.
4. Popliteal angle: Hold infant supine with pelvis flat, thigh held in knee- chest position. Extend leg by gentle pressure and measure popliteal angle.
5. Scarf sign: With baby supine, pull infant's hand across the neck toward opposite shoulder. Determine how far elbow will reach across. Score 0 if elbow reaches opposite axillary line, 1 if past midaxillary line, 2 if past midline, and 3 if elbow unable to reach midline.
6. Heel-to-ear maneuver: With baby supine, draw foot as near to head as possible without forcing it. Observe distance between foot and head and degree of extension at knee.
D. Birth Trauma
1. Extradural fluid collections: See Table 18.3 and Fig. 18.3.
2. Fractured clavicle: Possible crepitus/deformity/decreased movement on day 1 ± swelling/discomfort on day 2.
3. Brachial plexus injuries: See Section XI.

B. Glucose
1. Glucose infusion rate (GIR): Preterm neonates require approximately 5 to 6 mg/kg/min of glucose (40 to 100 mg/dL).9 Term neonates require approximately 3 to 5 mg/kg/min of glucose. Calculate as follows:

GIR ( mg/kg/min) = 0.167 × [ % dextrose concentration] infusion rate	/ [Weight ( kg)]

2. Management of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia: Table 18.5 and Fig. 18.2 (see Chapters 1 and 10).
C. Electrolytes, Minerals, and Vitamins
1. Electrolyte requirements (Table 18.6)
2. Mineral and vitamin requirements:
a. Infants born at <34 weeks gestation have higher calcium, phosphorus, sodium, iron, and vitamin D requirements and require breastmilk fortifier or special preterm formulas with iron. Fortifier is generally added to breast milk after the 2nd week of life.
b. Iron: Preterm infants tolerating full enteral feeds require an elemental iron supplementation of 2 to 4 mg/kg/day. Timing of initiation remains controversial, generally after age 2 weeks.
c. Vitamin D: Infants fed breast milk without fortifier require 400 IU daily. Infants fed preterm formula require 200 IU/day. Infants fed full term formula should be supplemented 400 IU/day until consuming 1 liter daily.
d. ADEK: Indicated for infants with malabsorption and/or cholestasis tolerating full enteral feeds.
D. Nutrition

Gradually decrease glucose
infusion rate if receiving >5 mg/ kg/min
Monitor glucosuria. Consider insulin infusion for persistent hyperglycemia.

Monitor glucose levels every 30-60 min until normal.

 V. CYANOSIS IN THE NEWBORN	
A. Differential Diagnosis
1. General: Hypothermia, hypoglycemia, sepsis
2. Cardiac: Congestive heart failure, congenital cyanotic heart disease
3. Respiratory: Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), diaphragmatic hernia, pulmonary hypoplasia, choanal atresia, pneumothorax, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), TTN, pneumonia, meconium aspiration
4. Neurologic: Central apnea, central hypoventilation, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), meningitis
5. Hematologic: Polycythemia, methemoglobinemia
6. Medications: Respiratory depression from maternal medications (e.g., magnesium sulfate, narcotics, general anesthesia)
B. Evaluation
1. Physical examination: Note central vs. peripheral and persistent vs. intermittent cyanosis, respiratory effort, single vs. split S2, presence of heart murmur. Acrocyanosis is often a normal finding in newborns.
2. Clinical tests: Hyperoxia test (see Chapter 7) , preductal/postductal arte- rial blood gases or pulse oximetry to assess for right-to-left shunt, and transillumination of chest for possible pneumothorax.
3. Other data: Complete blood cell count (CBC) with differential, serum glucose, chest radiograph, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography. Consider blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures if sepsis is suspected and methemoglobin level if cyanosis is out of proportion to hypoxemia.

 VI. RESPIRATORY DISEASES	
A. General Respiratory Considerations
1. Exogenous surfactant therapy:
a. Indications: RDS in preterm infants, meconium aspiration, pneumo- nia, persistent pulmonary hypertension.
b. Administration: If infant is =26 weeks gestation, first dose is typically
given in delivery room or as soon as stabilized; repeat dosing can be
considered based on ongoing oxygen requirements and level of respira- tory support.
c. Complications: Pneumothorax, pulmonary hemorrhage.
2. Supplemental O2: Adjust inspired oxygen to maintain O2 saturation. Ideal target oxygen saturations vary based on factors such as gestational
age, chronologic age, and underlying conditions, and aims to minimize adverse outcomes from hypoxemia and hyperoxemia. Higher targets (>94%) can be used when the retinas are mature (see Section XIII) and in cases of pulmonary hypertension.10
B. Respiratory Distress Syndrome
1. Etiology: Deficiency of pulmonary surfactant resulting in increased sur- face tension and alveolar collapse. Surfactant is produced in increasing quantities after 32 weeks gestation.




INCIDENCE OF RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME BY GESTATIONAL AGE AND ANTENATAL STEROID ADMINISTRATION11-14

Gestational Age (week)Antenatal Steroids AdministeredAntenatal Steroids Not Administered<3035%60%30-3410%25%34-361.4%a; 5.5%2.3%a; 6.4%>372.6%5.4%aNeonates with severe respiratory distress syndrome.
Note: The use of antenatal corticosteroids in >34 weeks gestational age is controversial due to inconsistent data regard- ing efficacy and limited data regarding long-term effects.

2. Prevention:
a. Antenatal maternal administration of steroids >24 hours and <7 days prior to delivery, has been shown to decrease neonatal morbidity and mortality.11-14
(1) Generally, either two doses of betamethasone administered 24 hours apart or four doses of dexamethasone given every 12 hours.
(2) A single repeat course considered in women <34 weeks gestation and whose previous steroid course was administered >14 days prior. Serial courses not currently recommended.
b. Other factors that accelerate lung maturity include maternal hyper- tension, sickle cell disease, narcotic addiction, intrauterine growth retardation, prolonged rupture of the membranes, and fetal stress.
3. Incidence: Table 18.8
4. Risk factors: Prematurity, maternal diabetes, cesarean section without antecedent labor, perinatal asphyxia, second twin, previous infant with RDS.
5. Clinical presentation:
a. Respiratory distress worsens during first few hours of life, progresses over 48 to 72 hours, and subsequently improves.
b. Recovery is accompanied by brisk diuresis.
c. See Chapter 26 for imaging findings.
6. Management:
a. Ventilatory and oxygenation support
b. Surfactant therapy
C. Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn
1. Etiology: Idiopathic or secondary to conditions leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance. PPHN is most commonly seen in term or postterm infants, infants born by cesarean section, and infants with a history of fetal distress and low APGAR scores. It usually presents within 12 to 24 hours of birth:
a. Vasoconstriction secondary to hypoxemia and acidosis
b. Interstitial pulmonary disease (meconium aspiration syndrome, pneumonia)
c. Hyperviscosity syndrome (polycythemia)


d. Pulmonary hypoplasia, either primary or secondary to congenital diaphragmatic hernia or renal agenesis
2. Diagnostic features:
a. Severe hypoxemia (Pao2 <35 to 45 mmHg in 100% O2) dispropor- tionate to radiologic changes.
b. Structurally normal heart with right-to-left shunt at foramen ovale and/or ductus arteriosus; pre/postductal oxygenation gradient (=7 to 15 mmHg is significant).
c. Must be distinguished from cyanotic heart disease. Infants with cya- notic heart disease will have an abnormal cardiac examination and show little to no improvement in oxygen therapy or hyperventilation. See Chapter 7 for interpretation of hyperoxia test.
3. Principles of therapy:
a. Improve oxygenation: Supplemental oxygen administration and optimi- zation of oxygen-carrying capacity with blood transfusions as indicated.
b. Minimize pulmonary vasoconstriction:
(1) Minimal handling of infant or noxious procedures. Sedation and occasionally paralysis of intubated neonates may be necessary.
(2) Avoid severe hyperventilation associated hypocarbia (PCO2 <30 mmHg), which can be associated with myocardial ischemia and decreased cerebral blood flow. Hyperventilation may result in barotrauma and predispose to chronic lung disease. Consider high-frequency ventilation.
c. Maintenance of systemic blood pressure and perfusion: Reversal of right-to-left shunt through volume expanders and/or inotropes.
d. Consider pulmonary vasodilator therapy: see Chapter 1
(1) Inhaled nitric oxide (NO): Reduces pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Typical starting dose is 20 parts per million (ppm). Unlikely to have additional benefit at >40 ppm. Complications include met- hemoglobinemia (reduce NO dose for methemoglobin >4%), NO2 poisoning (reduce NO dose for NO2 concentration >1 to 2 ppm).
(2) Prostacyclin analog (e.g., epoprostenol): Pulmonary vasodilator, normally produced by lung when lung vessels are constricted.
(3) Sildenafil: Cyclic cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor; results in pulmonary vasodilation.
e. Broad-spectrum antibiotics: Sepsis is a common underlying cause of PPHN.
f. Consider extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO): Reserved for cases of severe cardiovascular instability, oxygenation index (OI) >40 for >3 hour, or alveolar-arterial gradient (A-aO2) =610 for 8 hours (see
Chapter 1 for OI and A-a gradient equations). Infants typically need
to be >2000 g and at >34 weeks gestation to be ECMO candidates. Obtain head ultrasound and consider EEG before initiating ECMO.
4. Mortality depends on underlying diagnosis: Mortality rates are gener- ally lower for RDS and meconium aspiration, but higher in sepsis and diaphragmatic hernia.


D. Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn
1. Etiology: Incomplete or delayed resorption of amniotic fluid from the lungs.
a. Immaturity of respiratory epithelial Na+ transport.
2. Risk factors: Birth by cesarean section, male sex, macrosomia, lower gestational age, maternal diabetes, maternal asthma, maternal smoking.
3. Diagnostic features:
a. Symptoms present within first 6 hours of delivery and resolve within first postnatal week, usually within 72 hours.
b. Tachypnea: greater than 60 breaths/min, often in the range of 80 to 100 breaths/min.
c. Retractions, grunting, or nasal flaring may be present. Cyanosis and hypoxia rare.
d. CXR consistent with retained fluid: congestion, perihilar streaking, fluid in the interlobar fissure.
e. Exclusion of other diagnoses, i.e. pneumonia, aspiration, congeni- tal malformations, subarachnoid hemorrhage, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), pneumothorax, acidosis, RDS.
4. Management:
a. NPO with gavage feedings or 10% dextrose-containing fluids via IV.
b. Supplemental oxygen and/or CPAP as indicated.
c. No proven benefit of adjuncts including diuretics or racemic epinephrine.
E. Pneumothorax
1. Seen in 1% to 2% of normal newborns.
2. Associated with use of high ventilatory pressures and underlying dis- eases such as RDS, meconium aspiration, and pneumonia.
3. Consider monitoring in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
4. Consider needle thoracostomy or chest tube placement (see Chapter 4).

 VII. APNEA AND BRADYCARDIA	
A. Apnea15
1. Definition: Respiratory pause >20 seconds or a shorter pause associated with cyanosis, pallor, hypotonia, or bradycardia <100 bpm. May be central (no diaphragmatic activity), obstructive (upper airway obstruction), or mixed.
2. Etiology: See Fig. 18.4. Apnea of prematurity occurs in most infants born at <28 weeks gestation, ~50% of infants born at 30 to 32 weeks gestation, and <7% of infants born at 34 to 35 weeks gestation. Usually resolves by 34 to 36 weeks postmenstrual age, but may persist after term in infants born at <25 weeks gestation.
3. Management:
a. Consider pathologic causes for apnea (e.g., meningitis, seizures).
b. Pharmacotherapy with caffeine or other stimulants.

Causes of apnea in the newborn. CNS, Central nervous system; PDA, patent ductus arteriosus. (From Klaus MH, Fanaroff AA. Care of the High-Risk Neonate. 5th ed. Philadelphia: WB Saunders; 2001:268.)

c. Continuous positive airway pressure or mechanical ventilation (see Chapter 1).
B. Bradycardia without Central Apnea
Etiologies include obstructive apnea, mechanical airway obstruction, gas- troesophageal reflux, increased intracranial pressure, increased vagal tone (defecation, yawning, rectal stimulation, and placement of nasogastric [NG] tube), electrolyte abnormalities, heart block.

 VIII. CARDIAC DISEASES	
A. Patent Ductus Arteriosus
1. Definition: Failure of ductus arteriosus to close in first 72 hours of life or reopening after functional closure. Typically results in left-to-right shunting of blood once PVR has decreased. If PVR remains high, blood may be shunted right to left, resulting in hypoxemia (see Section VI.C).
2. Epidemiology: Up to 60% in preterm infants weighing <1500 g and higher in those weighing <1000 g. Female-to-male ratio is 2:1.
3. Diagnosis:
a. Examination: Systolic murmur may be continuous and best heard at the left upper sternal border or left infraclavicular area. Bounding peripheral pulses with widened pulse pressure if large shunt. Hyperactive precordium and palmar pulses may be present.
b. ECG: Normal or left ventricular hypertrophy in small to moderate pat- ent ductus arteriosus (PDA); biventricular hypertrophy in large PDA.
c. Chest radiograph: May show cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings, depending on size of shunt.


d. Echocardiogram
4. Management:
a. Indications for treatment, timing of intervention, and best manage- ment strategy remain controversial.16,17
b. Indomethacin/Ibuprofen: Prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor; 80% closure rate in preterm infants
(1) Ibuprofen is as effective as indomethacin but fewer renal adverse effects.18
(2) Complications16-18: Transient decrease in glomerular filtra- tion rate and decreased urine output, transient gastroin- testinal bleeding (no increased incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis [NEC]), prolonged bleeding time, and disturbed platelet function for 7 to 9 days independent of platelet count (no increased incidence of intracranial hemorrhage). Spontaneous isolated intestinal perforations are seen with indomethacin use. Rates are higher with concomitant hydro- cortisone use.
c. Acetaminophen19-22: Insufficient evidence but thought to be as effec- tive as indomethacin/ibuprofen without effects on the kidneys and platelets.
d. Surgical ligation of the duct.
B. Cyanotic Heart Disease (See Chapter 7)

 IX. HEMATOLOGIC DISEASES	
A. Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia in the Newborn23
1. Overview:
a. During first 3 to 4 days of life, total serum bilirubin (TSB) increases to
6.5 ± 2.5 mg/dL.
b. Maximum rate of bilirubin increase for normal infants with nonhemo- lytic hyperbilirubinemia: 5 mg/dL/24 hr or 0.2 mg/dL/hr.
c. Always consider clinical jaundice or TSB >5 mg/dL on first day of life pathologic.
d. Risk factors: Birth weight <2500 g, exclusive breastfeeding, prema- turity, ABO incompatibility, cephalohematoma or significant bruising, predischarge bilirubin in high-risk zone, observed jaundice in first 24 hours, gestational age 35 to 36 weeks, infant of a diabetic mother, previous sibling requiring phototherapy, low albumin, infection, race.
2. Evaluation:
a. Maternal prenatal testing: ABO and Rh (D) typing and serum screen for isoimmune antibodies.
b. Infant or cord blood: Blood and Rh typing (if maternal blood type is O, Rh negative, or prenatal blood typing was not performed).
Consider hemoglobin, blood smear, glucose-6-phosphate dehydroge- nase (GPD) testing, direct Coombs test.


3. Management:
a. Phototherapy: Ideally, intensive phototherapy should produce a TSB decline of 1 to 2 mg/dL within 4 to 6 hours, with further subsequent decline. Guidelines:
(1) Preterm newborn (Table 18.9)
(2) Term newborn (Fig. 18.5)
b. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (>35 weeks gestational age): In isoimmune hemolytic disease, IVIG administration (0.5 to 1 g/kg over 2 hours) is recommended if TSB is rising despite intensive photo- therapy or TSB is within 2 to 3 mg/dL of exchange transfusion level (see Chapter 15 for discussion of IVIG).

c. Neonatal double-volume exchange transfusion (see Table 18.9 and Fig. 18.6):
(1) Volume: 160 mL/kg for full-term infant, 160 to 200 mL/kg for preterm infant.
(2) Route: During exchange, blood is removed through umbilical arterial catheter (UAC) and an equal volume is infused through UVC. If UAC is unavailable, use a single venous catheter.
(3) Procedure: Replaces up to 85% of infant's circulation. Exchange in 15-mL aliquots for full-term infants. Exchange at 2 to 3 mL/kg/ min in premature/less stable infants to avoid hemolysis.
(4) Complications: Emboli, thromboses, hemodynamic instability, electrolyte disturbances, coagulopathy, infection, death.
NOTE: CBC, reticulocyte count, peripheral smear, bilirubin, Ca2+, glucose, total protein, infant blood type, Coombs test, and newborn screen should be performed on a preexchange sample of blood; they are of no diagnostic value with postexchange blood. If indicated, save preexchange blood for serologic or genetic studies.
B. Conjugated Hyperbilirubinemia (See Chapter 12)
1. Definition: Direct bilirubin >2.0 mg/dL and >10% of TSB.


2. Etiology: Biliary obstruction/atresia, choledochal cyst, hyperalimentation, a1-antitrypsin deficiency, hepatitis, sepsis, infections (especially urinary tract infections), hypothyroidism, inborn errors of metabolism, cystic fibrosis, red blood cell abnormalities.
3. Management: Ursodiol for infants on full feeds; consider supplementa- tion with fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K); otherwise depends on etiol- ogy. Phototherapy is not contraindicated but poses the risk for "bronze baby" syndrome.
C. Polycythemia
1. Definition: Venous hematocrit >65% confirmed on two consecutive samples. May be falsely elevated when obtained by heel stick or falsely lower when obtained by arterial stick.
2. Etiologies: Delayed cord clamping, twin-twin transfusion, maternal-fetal transfusion, intrauterine hypoxia, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, maternal diabetes, neonatal thyrotoxicosis, congenital adrenal hyperpla- sia, trisomies.
3. Clinical findings: Plethora, respiratory distress, cardiac failure, tachy- pnea, hypoglycemia, irritability, lethargy, seizures, apnea, jitteriness, poor feeding, thrombocytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia.
4. Complications: Hyperviscosity predisposes to venous thrombosis and CNS injury. Hypoglycemia may result from increased erythrocyte utiliza- tion of glucose.
5. Management: Partial exchange transfusion for symptomatic infants, with isovolemic replacement of blood with isotonic fluid. Blood is exchanged in 10- to 20-mL increments to reduce hematocrit to <55%.
Estimated blood volume = birth weight (kg) × 90 mL/kg

 X. GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASES	
A. Necrotizing Enterocolitis
1. Definition: Serious intestinal inflammation and injury thought to be sec- ondary to bowel ischemia, immaturity, and infection. Occurs principally in infants who have been fed.
2. Risk factors: Prematurity, asphyxia, African American race, hypotension, polycythemia-hyperviscosity syndrome, umbilical vessel catheteriza- tion, exchange transfusion, bacterial and viral pathogens, enteral feeds, PDA, congestive heart failure, cyanotic heart disease, RDS, intrauterine cocaine exposure.
3. Clinical findings: See Table EC 18.B.
a. Systemic: Temperature instability, apnea, bradycardia, metabolic acidosis, hypotension, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.
b. Intestinal: Blood in stool, absent bowel sounds, and/or abdominal tenderness or mass. Elevated pregavage residuals in the absence of other clinical symptoms rarely raise a suspicion of NEC.
c. Radiologic: Ileus, intestinal pneumatosis, portal vein gas, ascites, pneumoperitoneum (see Chapter 26).

4. Management: Nothing by mouth, NG tube decompression, maintain adequate hydration and perfusion, broad spectrum antibiotics for 7 to 10 days based on hospital antibiogram, surgical consultation. Surgery is performed for signs of perforation or necrotic bowel.
5. Minimizing risk of NEC:
a. Several studies link the use of probiotics and a decreased risk of NEC.24 However, variations among formulations of probiotics, dos- ing, and lack of long-term studies on outcome have prevented the standard use of probiotics in the NICU.25
b. There have been additional studies on supplements including
L-arginine and lactoferrin.26-28 Data remains insufficient to support a practice recommendation.29
c. The exclusive use of human milk, including donor breast milk, has been shown to decrease the risk of NEC and associated mortality.30
B. Bilious Emesis
See Table EC 18.C and Chapter 12.
1. Mechanical: Annular pancreas, intestinal atresia/duplication/malrotation/ obstruction (including adjacent organomegaly), meconium plug or ileus, Hirschsprung disease, imperforate anus.
2. Functional (i.e., poor motility): NEC, electrolyte abnormalities, sepsis. NOTE: Must eliminate malrotation as an etiology because volvulus is a surgi- cal emergency.

 XI. NEUROLOGIC DISEASES	
A. Neonatal Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy:
1. Initial Management31
2. Hypothermia protocol: Infants with evidence of HIE shortly after birth who are >36 weeks gestation should be considered for hypothermia. Protocol should be initiated within 6 hours of delivery.
3. Criteria for hypothermia vary by center but typically include one or more of the following:
a. Cord gas or blood gas in the first hour of life with a pH of <7.0 or base deficit of >16. For infants with a pH of 7.01 to 7.15 or base deficit of 10 to 15.9, additional criteria should be met (e.g., signifi- cant perinatal event).
b. 10-minute APGAR =5.
c. Evidence of moderate to severe encephalopathy.
d. Need for assisted ventilation at birth for at least 10 minutes.
4. Severity and outcome of HIE in full-term neonate: Table 18.10.
B. Intraventricular Hemorrhage
1. Definition: IVH usually arises in the germinal matrix and periventricular regions of the brain.

Avery's Neonatology. 6th ed. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 2005.

2. Incidence:
a. 30% to 40% of infants <1500 g; 50% to 60% of infants <1000 g
b. Highest incidence within first 72 hours of life: 60% within 24 hours, 85% within 72 hours, and <5% after 1 week of age
3. Diagnosis and classification:
a. Ultrasonography; grade is based on maximum amount of hemor- rhage seen by age 2 weeks:
(1) Grade I: Hemorrhage in germinal matrix only
(2) Grade II: IVH without ventricular dilation
(3) Grade III: IVH with ventricular dilation
  (4) Grade IV: Periventricular hemorrhagic infarct with or without IVH. NOTE: Many institutions use descriptive data (as opposed to the grading system) to denote severity of IVH.
4. Screening: Indicated in infants <32 weeks gestational age within 72 hours of life; repeat in 1 to 2 weeks.
5. Outcome: Infants with grade III and intraparenchymal hemorrhages have an increased risk for neurodevelopmental disabilities and posthemor-

Upper arm, lower arm, and hand involved. Horner syndrome (ptosis, anhidrosis, and miosis) exists if T1 is involved.



C. Periventricular White Matter Injury
1. Definition and ultrasound findings: Ischemic necrosis of periventricular white matter, characterized by CNS depression within first week of life and later findings of cysts on ultrasound with or without ventricular enlargement (caused by cerebral atrophy) or noncystic white matter injury visualized by MRI.
2. Incidence: More common in preterm infants but also occurs in term infants.
3. Etiology: Primarily ischemia-reperfusion injury, hypoxia, acidosis, hypo- glycemia, acute hypotension, low cerebral blood flow.
4. Outcome: Commonly associated with cerebral palsy with or without sensory and cognitive deficits.
D. Neonatal Seizures (See Chapter 20)
E. Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome
1. Onset of symptoms usually occurs within first 24 to 72 hours of life (metha- done may delay symptoms until 96 hours or later). Symptoms may last weeks to months. Box 18.1 shows signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal.
2. Increasing evidence supports benefit of nonpharmacologic manage- ment,32 including rooming in, breastfeeding, skin-to-skin, swaddling, and environmental controls such as decreased disruptions.
F. Peripheral Nerve Injuries
1. Etiology: Result from lateral traction on shoulder (vertex deliveries) or head (breech deliveries).
2. Clinical features (Table 18.11).
3. Management: Evaluate for associated trauma (clavicular and humeral fractures, shoulder dislocation, facial nerve injury, cord injuries). Full recovery is seen in 85% to 95% of cases in first year of life.

A. Lower Urinary Tract Obstruction
1. Definition: Rare birth defect caused by partial or complete blockage of the urethra. Common causes include posterior urethral valves (PUV), urethral atresia, and triad syndrome (constricted narrowing in mid- portion of urethra). More common in males.


2. Diagnosis and Evaluation: Fetal anatomy ultrasound (18 to 24 weeks) with visualization of markedly distended bladder, often with a thickened wall (greater than 2 mm).33 A "keyhole" sign representing dilation of the posterior urethral valve proximal to the obstruction may be seen, but is not specific.
a. Other tests include comprehensive anatomic survey or fetal MRI, echocardiogram, and karyotype to rule out co-existing abnormalities and determine gender. More than 10% of cases are associated with Trisomy 13, 18, or 21.
b. Vesicocentesis can evaluate renal function by serially assessing urine electrolytes at 24 to 48 hour intervals.
3. Clinical findings: Ureterectasis, caliectasis, hydronephrosis, pulmonary hypoplasia, renal dysplasia, oligohydramnios, clubfeet, Potter facies.
4. Management: Fetal vesicoamniotic shunting or cystoscopy. Consultation with pediatric urology and nephrology to review postnatal course includ- ing dialysis, vesicostomy, and transplantation. Elective termination or expectant management should be offered for fetuses with poor prognos- tic profiles (Table EC 18.E).
B. Bladder Exstrophy-Epispadias-Cloacal Exstrophy Complex
1. Definition: Anomalies involving urinary tract eversion; with genitourinary, musculoskeletal, and occasionally gastrointestinal malformations. See Table EC 18.F for comparison.
2. Diagnosis: Fetal anatomy ultrasound showing abnormality of bladder filling, low-set umbilical cord, abdominal mass that increases in size throughout pregnancy, separation of pubic bones and small genitals.
3. Management: Reconstructive surgery that aims to establish bladder continence, preserve renal function, repair epispadias and genitalia, and close the pelvic bones.

 XIII. RETINOPATHY OF PREMATURITY34	
A. Definition
Interruption of normal progression of retinal vascularization.
B. Etiology
Exposure of the immature retina to high oxygen concentrations can result in vasoconstriction and obliteration of the retinal capillary network, followed by vasoproliferation. Risk is correlated to degree of prematurity.
C. Diagnosis
Dilated funduscopic examination should be performed in the following patients:
1. All infants born =30 weeks gestation
2. Infants born >30 weeks gestation with unstable clinical course, includ-
ing those requiring cardiorespiratory support
3. Any infant with a birth weight =1500 g
D. Timing35
1. All infants born =27 weeks gestation, initial retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening examination performed at 31 weeks postmenstrual age.

 I. PRENATAL ASSESSMENT OF FETAL HEALTH	
A. Fetal Anomaly Screening
1. Fetal screening:
a. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS): Segment of placenta obtained either at 8 to 11 weeks gestation. Detects chromosomal abnormalities and metabolic disorders; however, it cannot detect neural tube defects or measure a-fetoprotein (AFP). Complications include pregnancy loss (0.7% to 2%), maternal infection, increased risk for feto-maternal hemorrhage, and fetal limb and jaw malformations.
b. Amniocentesis: 20 to 30 mL of amniotic fluid is withdrawn under ultrasound guidance after 16 to 18 weeks gestation. Detects chromo- somal abnormalities, metabolic disorders, and neural tube defects.
Complications include pregnancy loss (0.06% to 1.0%), leakage of amniotic fluid (1.7%), chorioamnionitis, vertical transmission to infant in mothers with chronic viral infections, and fetal scarring or dimpling of the skin.
c. Cell free DNA is a noninvasive prenatal screening test available for common trisomies and fetal sex determination. However, there are still limitations to this testing and further diagnostic testing is typically recommended for positive results.1
2. Anatomy ultrasound: Performed at 18 to 20 weeks gestation.
3. Maternal AFP: (Box EC 18.B)
B. Fetal Health
1. Amniotic fluid volume estimation and amniotic fluid index (AFI): (Box EC 18.C). AFI is calculated using ultrasound by adding together width of amniotic fluid pockets in four quadrants
2. Biophysical profile test: (Table EC 18.H)
3. Intrapartum Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) Monitoring:
a. Normal baseline FHR: 120 to 160 beats/min (bpm). Mild bradycardia is 100 to 120 bpm. Severe bradycardia is <90 bpm.
b. Normal beat-to-beat variability: Deviation from baseline of >6 bpm. Absence of variability is <2 bpm from baseline and is a sign of poten- tial fetal distress, particularly when combined with variable or late decelerations.
c. Accelerations: Associated with fetal movements, are benign, and indicate fetal well-being.
d. Decelerations:
(1) Early decelerations: Begin with onset of contractions. Heart rate reaches nadir at peak of contraction and returns to baseline as con- traction ends. Early decelerations occur secondary to changes in vagal tone after brief hypoxic episodes or head compression and are benign.
(2) Variable decelerations: Represent umbilical cord compression and have no uniform temporal relationship to the onset of a contraction. Variable decelerations are considered severe when

heart rate drops to <60 bpm for about 60 seconds, with a slow recovery to baseline.
(3) Late decelerations: Occur after peak of contraction, persist after con- traction stops, and show a slow return to baseline. Late decelerations result from uteroplacental insufficiency and indicate fetal distress.
C. Estimation of Gestational Age
1. Last menstrual period (LMP). Naegele rule gives most accurate determi- nation of gestational age
Estimation due date = (LMP - 3 months) + 7 days
2. Ultrasound: Crown-rump length obtained between 6 and 12 weeks gestation predicts gestational age ± 3 to 4 days. After 12 weeks,

 I. URINALYSIS1: TABLE 19.1	
A. Common indications include: Infectious workup (urinary tract infection [UTI], pyelonephritis), abdominal trauma, suspected diabetes or renal disease, rhabdomyolysis, edema, failure to thrive.
B. Best if urine specimen is evaluated within 1 hour of voiding, otherwise should be kept at 4°C.
C. Annual screening UAs are not recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) unless patient is at high risk of chronic kidney disease.

 II. KIDNEY FUNCTION TESTS	
A. Tests of Glomerular Function
1. Glomerulogenesis is complete at 36 weeks gestation. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) increases over the first two years of life related to glomerular maturation.
2. Normal GFR values, as measured by inulin clearance (gold standard), are shown in Table 19.2.
3. Creatinine clearance (CCr):
Closely approximates inulin clearance in the normal range of GFR.
When GFR is low, CCr overestimates GFR. May be inaccurate in children with obstructive uropathy or problems with bladder
emptying secondary to challenges getting complete timed urine collections.
CCr (mL / min / 1.73 m2) = [U× (V / P)] × 1.73 / BSA,

where U (mg/dL) = urinary creatinine concentration; V (mL/min)= total urine volume (mL) divided by the duration of the collection (min) (24 hours = 1440 minutes); P (mg/dL) = serum creatinine concentration (may average two levels); and BSA (m2) = body surface area.
4. Estimated GFR (eGFR) from plasma creatinine: Varies related to body size/ muscle mass. If body habitus is markedly abnormal or a precise mea- surement of GFR is needed, consider other methods. Creatinine must be in steady state to estimate GFR; use caution in the setting of acute kidney injury. Three methods to calculate estimated GFR:

AGA,      Appropriate      for      gestational      age. Data from Schwartz GJ, Brion LP, Spitzer A. The use of plasma creatinine concentration for estimating glomerular filtration rate in infants, children, and adolescents. Pediatr Clin North Am. 1987;34:571.



a. Bedside Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) cohort: Only applicable if creatinine measured by enzymatic assay. Recommended for eGFR determination in children aged 1 to 16 years. Estimated GFRs of =75 mL/ min/1.73 m2 determined by this equation likely represent normal kidney function; clinical correlation is recommended with GFR estimation.2
eGFR(mL / min / 1.73 m2) = 0.413× (L / Pcr),
where 0.413 is the proportionality constant, L = height (cm), and Pcr
= plasma creatinine (mg/dL).
b. Schwartz equation: Historical equation for eGFR in children. However, laboratories are increasingly shifting to enzymatic assays to determine creatinine; use of enzymatically determined creatinine (vs Jaffe method) with the Schwartz equation leads to overestimation of GFR and should be considered when applying clinically:

eGFR(mL / min / 1.73 m2) = kL / Pcr,
where k = proportionality constant (Table 19.3); L = height (cm); and
Pcr = plasma creatinine (mg/dL).
c. Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI): Used to calculate GFR in those
>18 years old. Available at NKDEP website (see Section XII).
5. Other measurements of GFR: May be used when more precise deter- mination of GFR is needed (e.g., dosing of chemotherapy). These methods include iothalamate, DTPA, and iohexol. Cystatin C is a low molecular protein that can also be used to estimate GFR and is more accurate than serum creatinine in individuals with conditions that significantly impact muscle mass, the source of creatinine.
B. Tests of Kidney Tubular Function
1. Proximal tubule and solute handling:
a. Proximal tubule reabsorption: Proximal tubule is responsible for reab- sorption of electrolytes, glucose, and amino acids. Studies to evaluate


proximal tubular function compare urine and blood levels of specific compounds, arriving at a percentage of tubular reabsorption (Tx):
Tx = 1 -[(Ux / Px)/(UCr / PCr)]×100 %,
where Ux = concentration of compound in urine; Px = concentration of compound in plasma; Ucr = concentration of creatinine in urine; and Pcr = concentration of creatinine in plasma. This formula can be used for amino acids, electrolytes, calcium, and phosphorus. It is commonly used to calculate tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TRP). In a patient with hypophosphatemia and preserved proximal tubular function, the tubular reabsorption of phosphate would be expected to be near 100%.
b. Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa)3: Commonly used to assess tubular function. Must consider sodium and volume status. May be inaccurate with recent diuretic use.
FENa = [(UNa / PNa) / (UCr / PCr)] × 100 %,
where UNa = concentration of sodium in urine; and PNa = concen- tration of sodium in plasma. FENa is usually <1% in prerenal azote- mia or glomerulonephritis, and >1% (usually >3%) in acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or postrenal azotemia. Infants have diminished ability to reabsorb sodium; FENa in volume-depleted infants is <3%.
c. Fractional excretion of urea (FEurea): May be useful in certain clinical scenarios, including patients on diuretics. Use FENa equation above, substituting urea for sodium. FEurea is usually <35% in prerenal azotemia and >50% in ATN.3
d. Fractional excretion of bicarbonate (FHCO3): May help differentiate the types of renal tubular acidosis (RTA). The majority of bicarb reabsorption occurs in proximal tubule.
FeHCO3 = [(UHCO3 / PHCO3) / (UCr / PCr)] × 100 %,
Normal FEHCO3 is <5%. Distal RTA is usually <5%. >15% suggests proximal (Type II) RTA.
2. Distal tubule and pH balance:
a. Urine anion gap (UAG): Used as an indirect measure of ammonium production in the distal nephron.
UAG = UNa + UK - UCl,
where UNa = concentration of sodium in urine; UK = concentration of potassium in urine; and UCl = concentration of chloride in urine.
Positive UAG (usually >20) suggests a distal RTA. Negative UAG (usu- ally <-20) suggests high urinary NH4+ (e.g., secondary to diarrhea).
b. Urine pH: A urine acidification defect (distal RTA) should be sus- pected when random urine pH values are >6 in the presence of moderate systemic metabolic acidosis. Confirm acidification defects by simultaneous venous or arterial pH, plasma bicarbonate concen- tration, and determination of the pH of fresh urine.
c. Urine osmolality: Urine is concentrated distally in the kidney tubules. Urine osmolality, ideally on a first morning urine specimen, may be

used to evaluate capacity to concentrate urine. If osmolality is >600 mOsm/L, then tubular dysfunction, including disease states such as diabetes insipidus leading to inappropriate water loss, is unlikely. For more formal testing, see the water deprivation test in Chapter 10.
d. Urine calcium: Hypercalciuria may be seen with distal RTA, vitamin D intoxication, hyperparathyroidism, immobilization, excessive calcium intake, use of steroids or loop diuretics, or an idiopathic cause. Diagnosis is as follows:
(1). 24-hour urine: Calcium >4 mg/kg/24 hr (gold standard)
(2). Spot urine: Determine calcium/creatinine (Ca/Cr) ratio. Normal urine Ca/Cr ratio does not rule out hypercalciuria. Correlate clini- cally and follow elevated spot urine Ca/Cr ratio with a 24-hr urine calcium determination if indicated (Table 19.4).4

Note: See Chapter 1 for the management of acute hypertension and Chapter 7 for normal blood pressure (BP) parameters.
A. Definition
Hypertension is defined as the sustained elevation of BP at or above the 95th percentile for those <13 years or =130/80 for those =13 years. Any BP that is >90th percentile or =120/80 should be repeated at a clinic visit; if persistently elevated when confirmed by manual auscultation, the child should return for a repeat measurement for confirmation (see Section III.E).
B. Measurement of Blood Pressure in Children
1. All children =3 years should have BP measured annually. Children
=3 years should have BP measured at all visits if at increased risk for hypertension: obesity, taking medications known to increase BP, renal
disease, history of aortic arch obstruction/coarctation, diabetes.
2. Children aged <3 years with risk factors should have BP measured at all well-child care visits. Risk factors include history of prematurity
<32 weeks gestation or small for gestational age, very low birth weight, congenital heart disease, kidney/urologic disease or family history of

kidney disease, recurrent UTIs, malignancy, solid organ or bone marrow transplant, taking medications known to increase BP, systemic illness associated with hypertension, and evidence of increased intracranial pressure.
3. BP should be measured in a seated position in an upper extremity after 5 minutes of rest with feet/back/arm supported and mid-cuff at heart level; auscultation is preferred. Appropriate cuff size has a blad- der width at least 40% of upper arm circumference at midway point.
Bladder length should cover 80% to 100% of arm circumference. Cuffs that are too small may result in falsely elevated BPs. Choose a larger- sized cuff if there is a choice between two.
C. Etiologies of Hypertension in Neonates, Infants, and Children (Table 19.5)
Drugs causing hypertension include glucocorticoids, calcineurin inhibitors, sympathomimetics, oral contraceptives, stimulants (methylphenidate), ephedrine, erythropoietin, NSAIDs, caffeine, tobacco, ethanol, cocaine, amphetamines.
D. Evaluation of Chronic Hypertension
1. Rule out factitious causes of hypertension (improper cuff size or measurement technique [e.g., manual vs. oscillometric]), non- pathologic causes of hypertension (e.g., fever, pain, anxiety, muscle spasm), and iatrogenic mechanisms (e.g., medications, excessive fluid administration).


2. History: Headache, blurred vision, dyspnea on exertion, edema, obstructive sleep apnea symptoms (including poor sleep quality or duration), endocrine symptoms (diaphoresis, flushing, constipa- tion, weakness, etc.), history of neonatal intensive care unit stay, rule out pregnancy, history of UTIs, history of medications and supple- ments, illicit drug use, or any family history of kidney dysfunction or hypertension.
3. Physical examination: Four-extremity pulses and BPs, endocrine disease stigmata, edema, hypertrophied tonsils, skin lesions, abdominal mass, or abdominal bruit.
4. Clinical evaluation of confirmed hypertension:
a. Laboratory studies:
(1) All patients: Urinalysis (UA), serum electrolytes, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lipid profile
(2) Obese patients: Hgb A1c, AST/ALT, fasting lipid panel
(3) Consider on basis of history and exam: Fasting serum glucose, thyroid stimulating hormone, drug screen, polysomnography, complete blood count
b. Clinical practice guidelines recommend 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) be conducted in all children with persistently elevated blood pressure to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension. Other at-risk populations (e.g., coarctation of the aorta status-post repair, CKD, history of hypertension) should also have this monitoring done yearly regardless of clinic blood pressure.
c. Imaging:
(1) Renal ultrasound in patients <6 years old or those with abnormal UA or renal function.
(2) Echocardiography to evaluate for left ventricular hypertrophy if pharmacologic treatment considered.
(3) Consider renovascular imaging if renal artery stenosis is suspected.
d. Patients =6 years of age do not require extensive evaluation for secondary causes if they have a strong family history of hypertension (HTN), are overweight, and do not have any evidence of secondary
causes on history and physical exam.
E. Classification and Treatment of Hypertension (Table 19.6)
Target: SBP and DBP to <90th percentile and <130/80 mmHg in adoles- cents =13 years old. Consider target 50th percentile in those with CKD.
1. Nonpharmacologic: Aerobic exercise, sodium restriction, smoking
cessation, and weight loss indicated in all patients with hypertension. Reevaluate BP after lifestyle interventions, and begin pharmacologic therapy if hypertension persists.
2. Pharmacologic: Indications include secondary hypertension, symptom- atic hypertension, stage 2 hypertension without a clearly modifiable fac- tor (e.g., obesity), diabetes mellitus, and persistent hypertension despite nonpharmacologic measures.

3. Treatment monitoring: Repeat echocardiogram every 6 to 12 months in those with cardiac end organ damage or those at high risk. Repeated 24-hour ABPM can be used to assess treatment effectiveness as needed.


F. Antihypertensive Drugs for Outpatient Management of Primary Hypertension in Children 1 to 17 Years of Age
Clinical guidelines recommend angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, thiazide diuretics, or long-acting calcium channel blockers as first-line medications for management of chronic hypertension in children.6 Medication choice may be impacted by underly- ing comorbidities, contraindications, and side effects. Providers should familiarize themselves with existing guidelines, medication contraindica- tions, and side effects. A list of medications and common side effects is found in Table 19.7.

A. History
Highly dependent on patient age. Inquire about fever, dysuria, frequency, urgency, and back/abdominal pain. Obtain voiding history (stool, urine), stream characteristics in toilet-trained children, sexual activity, sexual abuse, circumcision status, prolonged/bubble baths or swimming, evalua- tion of growth curve, recent antibiotic use, and family history of vesicoure- teral reflux (VUR), recurrent UTIs, or chronic kidney disease.
B. Physical Examination
Vital signs, abdominal examination for tenderness, flank masses, bowel distention, evidence of impaction, meatal stenosis or circumcision in males, vulvovaginitis or labial adhesions in females, neurologic examination of lower extremities, perineal sensation and reflexes, and rectal and sacral examination (for anteriorly placed anus).


C. Risk Factors
2011 AAP guidelines,8 reaffirmed in 2016,9 for children 2 to 24 months provide resources to help clinicians stratify the risk of UTI in the absence of another source of infection in a febrile child.
1. Females are at higher risk for UTI than males.
2. Uncircumcised males are at higher risk than circumcised males.
3. Other risk factors include non-black race, fever =39°C, and fever >1 to 2 days.
D. Methods of Urine Collection
1. If a child is 2 months to 2 years old, has a fever, and appears sufficiently ill to warrant immediate antibiotics, obtain UA and urine culture by transurethral catheterization. Suprapubic percutaneous aspiration may be useful in critically ill children, is generally very safe, and is similar to bladder catheterization in sensitivity and specificity.
2. If a child is 2 months to 2 years old, has a fever, and does not appear ill enough to warrant immediate antibiotics, obtain urine by catheterization or the most convenient method available. Bag or absorbent pad may be helpful when UTI is unlikely (to rule out infection), but both have very high false positive rates (>75% of cultures positive) and should not be sent for culture.8 If UA does not suggest UTI, it is reasonable to avoid antimicrobial therapy. If UA does suggest UTI, urine culture should be obtained by catheterization.
3. If a child is >2 years old and toilet trained, may provide midstream clean-catch urine specimen.
E. Diagnosis
To establish the diagnosis of UTI, both UA results suggestive of infection and positive urine culture are recommended.
1. Nitrite test:
a. Detects products of reduction of dietary nitrates by urinary gram- negative bacterial species (especially Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and Proteus).
b. Sensitivity 15% to 82% and specificity 90% to 100% for UTI.8
c. Special circumstances: False-negative (low sensitivity) results commonly occur with insufficient time (<4 hours) for conversion of urinary nitrates to nitrites (age-dependent voiding frequency) and inability of bacteria to reduce nitrates to nitrites (many gram-positive organisms such as Enterococcus, Mycobacterium spp., and fungi).
2. Leukocyte esterase test:
a. Detects esterase released from leukocyte lysis.
b. Sensitivity 67% to 84% and specificity 64% to 92% for UTI.8
3. Pyuria is defined at a threshold of =5 WBCs/hpf. Absence of pyuria is rare if a true UTI is present.
4. Urine culture:
a. Transurethral catheterization or suprapubic aspiration: >50,000 colony-forming units (CFU) per mL diagnostic of UTI. Some sources suggest >10,000 CFU/mL in the presence of fever, symptoms, and pyuria may also be diagnostic.10


b. Clean catch: >100,000 CFU/mL necessary to diagnose a UTI.
c. Bagged specimen: Should not be used to collect urine culture.
d. Catheter-associated (indwelling urethral or suprapubic): No specific data for pediatric patients. Adult Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines define it as presence of symptoms and signs compatible with UTI and >1000 CFU/mL of one or more bacterial species in a single catheter urine specimen or in a midstream voided urine specimen from a patient whose catheter has been removed within previous 48 hours.11
F. Classification
Pyelonephritis (upper UTI), rather than cystitis (lower UTI), is suggested by fever =38.5°C (especially if lasting >48 hours after initiating appropriate antibiotics), systemic symptoms, costovertebral angle tenderness, elevated CRP, leukocytosis.
G. Imaging
1. Renal and bladder ultrasound (RBUS): Evaluates for anatomic abnormalities and abscesses. Indications include children 2 to 24 months with first UTI, recurrent or atypical UTIs, or if no response to treatment within 48 hours. If there is clinical improvement <48 hours and follow up is reliable, should be done after full recovery. If there is no response to treatment or follow up is uncertain, then RBUS during illness is indicated.
2. Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG): Evaluates bladder anatomy, empty- ing, and looks for signs of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Should not be obtained routinely after first febrile UTI. Indications include children 2 to 24 months with abnormal RBUS findings (hydronephrosis, scarring, or other findings suggestive of either high-grade VUR or obstructive uropathy), complicated or recurrent pyelonephritis.8 Consider if family history of VUR. Optimal time is 2 to 6 weeks after infection.
H. Treatment of Culture-Positive Urinary Tract Infection
For empiric therapy, see Chapter 17.
1. Organisms:
a. E. coli is the most common cause of pediatric UTI.
b. Other common pathogens: Klebsiella, Proteus spp., Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus aureus.
c. Neonatal UTI: Group B streptococci and other bloodborne pathogens.
d. Enterococcus and Pseudomonas are more prevalent in abnormal hosts (e.g., recurrent UTI, abnormal anatomy, neurogenic bladder, hospitalized patients, or those with frequent bladder catheteriza- tions). Consider blood cultures if urine grows uncommon organism or Staphylococcus.
2. Treatment considerations and duration:
a. Route: Parenteral antibiotics for children who are toxic, dehy- drated, or unable to tolerate oral medication due to vomiting or noncompliance.

Pediatrics. 1981;67:392.)

b. Duration: 3 to 5 days for uncomplicated cases12; 7 to 14 days for toxic children and those with pyelonephritis.
3. Inadequate response to therapy: Consider renal abscess or urinary obstruction; RBUS and repeat urine culture is indicated. Repeat cul- tures should also be considered in patients with recurrent UTIs to rule out persistent bacteriuria.
4. Management of VUR:
a. Classification of VUR: Fig. 19.1
b. Antibiotic prophylaxis: Evidence suggests that prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole reduces the risk of UTI recurrence by 50%, but with no significant difference in renal scarring. Some experts suggest that recent studies are insufficiently powered
to detect a difference in the relatively rare outcomes of renal


scarring, and thus recommend shifting guideline recommenda- tions from "no prophylaxis" to "selective prophylaxis" in certain groups of patients.13
c. Surgical intervention: Monitor persistence/grade of VUR annually, often in consultation with a pediatric urologist. Spontaneous resolution may occur, although less likely with higher grade. Higher-grade VUR that persists as the child grows may ultimately require surgical intervention.
5. Asymptomatic bacteriuria: Defined as bacteria in urine on microscopy and Gram stain in an afebrile, asymptomatic patient without pyuria. Antibiotics not necessary if voiding habits and urinary tract are normal.
6. Referral to pediatric urology: Consider in children with abnormal voiding patterns based on history or imaging, neurogenic bladder, abnormal anatomy, recurrent UTI, or poor response to appropriate antibiotics.

 V. PROTEINURIA14-16	
A. Definitions
1. Orthostatic proteinuria: Excretion of significant amounts of protein while in the upright position. A benign condition and common cause of pro- teinuria in children and adolescents.
2. Fixed proteinuria: Proteinuria found on first morning urine void over several consecutive days. Suggestive of kidney disease.
3. Microalbuminuria: Presence of albumin in urine below detectable range of dipsticks. In adults, defined as 30 to 300 mg/g creatinine. Most often used in screening for kidney disease secondary to diabetes.
4. Significant proteinuria: Urine protein to urine creatinine (UPr:UCr) ratio
0.2 to 2.0 mg/mg or 4 to 40 mg/m2/hr in a 24-hour collection.
5. Nephrotic-range proteinuria: UPr:UCr ratio >2 mg/mg or >40 mg/m2/ hr in a 24-hour collection. In adults, 24-hour urine protein excretion of 3000 mg/24 hours.
6. Nephrotic syndrome: Nephrotic-range proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema, and hyperlipidemia (cholesterol >200 mg/dL).
B. Methods of Detection
1. Urinalysis (see Table 19.1): Proteinuria on a urine dipstick should be verified by a urine protein/creatinine ratio in an appropriately collected first morning urine specimen. Urine samples collected immediately upon rising in the morning help distinguish the contribution of benign orthostatic proteinuria to the proteinuria detected on dipstick or ran- domly timed spot urine collection.
2. First morning urine protein/creatinine ratio:
a. Approximates 24-hour urine collections well.
b. Appropriate collection is essential for accurate results. A child must empty the bladder before going to bed. If the child gets up during the night, the bladder should be emptied before returning to bed. When the child wakes up in the morning, the urine sample should be provided immediately.

c. Normal ratios:
(1) <2 years old: <0.5 mg/mg
(2) >2 years old: <0.2 mg/mg
d. Abnormal ratios (mg/mg): Significant proteinuria detected on a first morning protein/creatinine ratio should prompt verification of appropri- ate collection. Repeat specimen should be analyzed within 1 to 2 weeks, or sooner based on clinical scenario (e.g., edema, hyperten- sion, or symptom of concern would prompt a more expedited workup).
3. 24-hour urine protein: May have a contribution from benign orthostatic proteinuria, which cannot be ruled out without a fractional urine collec- tion. Protein level >4 mg/m2/hr is considered significant.
C. Etiologies (Box 19.1)
See Section VI.E for discussion of nephrotic syndrome.
D. Evaluation15
Further evaluation is necessary if proteinuria is significant/symptomatic and not secondary to orthostatic proteinuria (Box 19.2).
E. Nephrotic Syndrome16
1. Epidemiology: Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome of childhood is the most common form, representing approximately 90% of cases in children between the ages of 1 and 10 years. Minimal change disease is the most common renal pathology found among children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in this age group. Nephrotic syndrome may be a manifestation of a primary kidney disease, a systemic disorder resulting in glomerular injury, or rarely medication.
2. Clinical manifestations: Hypoalbuminemia and decrease in oncotic pres- sure results in generalized edema. Initial swelling commonly occurs on the face (especially periorbital), as well as in the pretibial area. Eye swelling is often mistaken for allergic reactions or seasonal allergies (Box 19.3).







ETIOLOGIES OF NEPHROTIC SYNDROME
Primary Causes (90%)	Secondary Causes (10%)


3. Etiologies: See Table 19.8.
4. Investigations at first presentation: UA and microscopy (microhematuria present in 30% and is not prognostic); urine P/Cr ratio; serum albumin, total protein, cholesterol, creatinine; infectious workup (consider tuber- culosis, HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, as indicated).
5. Management of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome of childhood: Empirical corticosteroid treatment without kidney biopsy is recommended for children without atypical features. Hospitalization recommended for children with overwhelming edema or infection.


a. Steroid-responsive: Approximately 95% of patients with minimal change disease (MCD) and 20% with focal segmental glomeruloscle- rosis (FSGS) achieve remission within 4 to 8 weeks of starting pred- nisone. Response to corticosteroids is the best prognostic indicator, including the likelihood of underlying MCD.
(1) Although duration of therapy varies, one common regimen includes prednisone 60 mg/m2 daily or 2 mg/kg/day (maximum dose 60 mg/day) for 6 weeks, followed by 40 mg/m2 or 1.5 mg/kg on alternate days for 6 weeks.16
(2) Relapses of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome are treated with a shorter duration of corticosteroids, which also vary according to the center and the consensus body. Commonly, prednisone 60 mg/m2 or 2 mg/kg/day (maximum dose 60 mg/day) until urine protein is negative for 3 consecutive days, followed by 40 mg/m2 or 1.5 mg/kg on alternate days for 4 weeks.
b. Frequently relapsing: Defined as 2 or more relapses within 6 months of initial response, or 4 or more relapses in any 12-month period.
c. Steroid-dependent: Defined as 2 consecutive relapses during taper- ing or within 14 days of cessation of steroids. Some patients can be managed with low-dose steroids, given daily or on alternate days, but many will relapse. Second-line treatments for frequently relapsing and steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome: Cyclophosphamide, mycophe- nolate mofetil (MMF), calcineurin inhibitors, levamisole, or rituximab.
d. Steroid-resistant: Lack of remission or partial remission after 8 weeks of corticosteroids. Second-line agents, including calcineurin inhibitors or MMF, are often introduced once steroid resistance is confirmed.
e. Indications for renal biopsy: Macroscopic hematuria, age <12 months or >12 years, systemic or syndromic findings, persistent creatinine elevation >1 to 2 weeks, low complement levels, and per- sistent proteinuria after 4 to 8 weeks of adequate steroid treatment.17
6. Complications:
a. AKI; thromboembolic disease; potentially life-threatening infection. See Chapter 16 for vaccine recommendations.
b. Chronic systemic steroids: Cushingoid skin changes, cataracts, accelerated atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, gastric ulcer, mood swings, insomnia, insulin resistance, immunosuppression.

 VI. HEMATURIA18	
A. Definition
1. Microscopic hematuria: >5 RBCs/hpf on centrifuged urine. Not visible to the naked eye.
2. Macroscopic (gross) hematuria: Visible blood in urine.
3. Acute nephritic syndrome: Classically tea or cola-colored urine, facial or body edema, hypertension, and oliguria.
B. Etiologies: See Table 19.9.

C. Evaluation (Fig. 19.2)
Differentiate glomerular and extraglomerular hematuria: Examine urine sedi- ment, looking for RBC casts and protein.
1. Glomerular hematuria
a. Usually hypertensive; dysuria usually absent; edema, fever, pharyngi- tis, rash, and arthralgia may suggest glomerular disease.
b. Laboratory: Dysmorphic RBCs and casts on UA, complete blood cell count (CBC) with differential and smear, serum electrolytes with calcium, BUN/creatinine, serum protein/albumin, and other testing
driven by history and exam, including ANA, hepatitis B and C serolo- gies, HIV, audiology screen, if indicated.
c. Consider other studies to determine underlying diagnosis: C3/C4, antineutrophil antibody (c- and p-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibod- ies), anti-double-stranded DNA
2. Extraglomerular hematuria
a. Rule out infection: Urine culture, gonorrhea, chlamydia
b. Rule out trauma: History, consider imaging of abdomen/pelvis
c. Investigate other potential causes: Urine Ca/Cr ratio or 24-hour urine for kidney stone risk analysis, sickle cell screen, renal/bladder ultrasound. Consider serum electrolytes with calcium, coagulation studies.
D. Management (Fig. 19.3)

 VII. ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY19,20	
A. Definition
Sudden decline in kidney function; clinically represented by rising creati- nine, with or without changes in urine output.
B. Etiology (Table 19.10)
Causes are generally subdivided into three categories:
1. Prerenal: Impaired perfusion of kidneys, the most common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in children. Volume depletion is a common cause of prerenal AKI.
2. Renal:
a. Parenchymal disease due to vascular or glomerular lesions.
b. Acute tubular necrosis: Diagnosis of exclusion when no evidence of renal parenchymal disease is present and prerenal and postrenal causes have been eliminated, if possible.
3. Postrenal: Obstruction of the urinary tract, commonly due to inherited anatomic abnormalities in children.
C. Clinical Presentation
Pallor, decreased urine output, systemic and pulmonary edema, hypertension, vomiting, and lethargy. The hallmark of early kidney failure is often oliguria.
1. Oliguria: Urine output <0.5 mL/kg/hr (for at least 6 hours). May reflect intrinsic or obstructive kidney disease. Always interpret urine output in the context of physical exam, clinical scenario, and fluid delivery.

For example, low urine output may be appropriate (physiologic response to water depletion in a prerenal state) and "normal" urine output may be inappropriate in a volume-depleted patient (potentially representing kidney tubular damage or another pathologic state).
Laboratory differentiation of oliguria is found in Table 19.11.
2. Blood urea nitrogen/creatinine (BUN/Cr) ratio (both in mg/dL): Interpret ratios with caution in small children with low serum creatinine.
a. 10 to 20 (normal ratio): Suggests intrinsic renal disease in the setting of oliguria.




ETIOLOGIES OF ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY
INTRINSIC RENAL Acute Tubular Necrosis:
Hypoxic/ischemic insults
Drug-induced-aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, acyclovir, chemotherapeutic agents (ifosfamide, cisplatin)
Toxin-mediated-endogenous toxins (myoglobin, hemoglobin); exogenous toxins (ethylene glycol, methanol)
Interstitial Nephritis:
Drug-induced-ß-lactams, NSAIDs (may be associated with high-grade proteinuria), sulfonamides, PPIs
Idiopathic
Uric acid nephropathy:
Tumor lysis syndrome
Glomerulonephritis:
In most severe degree, presents as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN)
Vascular Lesions:
Renal artery thrombosis, renal vein thrombosis, cortical necrosis, hemolytic
uremic syndrome
Hypoplasia/Dysplasia:
Idiopathic or exposure to nephrotoxic drugs in utero
ACE, Angiotensin-converting enzyme; NSAIDs, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs; PPIs, proton pump inhibitors. Data from Andreoli SP. Acute kidney injury in children. Pediatr Nephrol. 2009;24:253-263.


LABORATORY DIFFERENTIATION OF OLIGURIA
TestPrerenalRenalFENa=1%>3%BUN/Cr ratio>20:1<10:1Urine specific gravity>1.015<1.010BUN, Blood urea nitrogen; Cr, creatinine; FENa, fractional excretion of sodium.


b. >20: Suggests volume depletion, prerenal azotemia, or gastrointesti- nal bleeding.
c. <5: Suggests liver disease, starvation, or inborn error of metabolism.


D. Acute Tubular Necrosis
Clinically defined by three phases:
1. Oliguric phase: Period of severe oliguria that may last days. If oliguria or anuria persists for longer than 3 to 6 weeks, kidney recovery from ATN is less likely.
2. High urine output phase: Begins with increased urine output and progresses to passage of large volumes of isosthenuric urine containing sodium levels of 80 to 150 mEq/L.
3. Recovery phase: Signs and symptoms usually resolve rapidly, but poly- uria may persist for days to weeks.
E. Treatment Considerations
1. Careful monitoring of volume status (daily weights, strict input/ output). Consider placement of indwelling catheter to monitor urine output.
2. Prerenal and postrenal factors should be addressed or excluded.
3. Intravascular volume resuscitation and maintenance with appropriate fluids in consultation with a pediatric nephrologist.
4. Monitor metabolic/electrolyte abnormalities, discontinue unnecessary nephrotoxic medications and follow drug levels closely when avail- able, adjust dosing of medications based on creatinine clearance (see Chapter 31), monitor blood pressure closely, and maintain appropriate nutrition (low phosphorus, low potassium).
5. See Section IX for indications for acute dialysis
F. Complications
1. Dependent on clinical severity.
2. Usually includes fluid overload (hypertension, congestive heart failure [CHF], or pulmonary edema), electrolyte disturbances (hyperkalemia), metabolic acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, and uremia.
G. Radiographic Imaging Considerations in AKI/CKD
1. To prevent radiographic contrast-induced nephropathy, select radio- graphic studies that do not require administration of a radiographic iodinated contrast media (RICM) if possible, particularly in high-risk populations, such as patients with AKI or CKD.21
2. If RICM is required, use of low or iso-osmolality contrast media is preferred.21
3. Hydration has been found to be effective in preventing or minimizing contrast-induced nephropathy in some studies of high-risk populations. Intravenous hydration 6 hours prior to and 6 to 12 hours after contrast administration has been studied.21
4. Use of N-acetylcysteine is controversial in preventing contrast-induced nephropathy.21
5. Gadolinium and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis: The triad of gadolinium use, a pro-inflammatory state, and renal impairment (GFR <30 mL/min per 1.73 m2, peritoneal or hemodialysis) is associated with nephrogenic


systemic fibrosis. Gadolinium is contraindicated in patients with GFR
<30 mL/min per 1.73 m2, and caution should be used at GFR levels between 30 and 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2.22

 VIII. CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE23	
A. Definition
Kidney damage for >3 months, as defined by structural or functional abnormalities, with or without decreased GFR. Classified as:
Stage I: Kidney injury with normal or increased GFR Stage II: GFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2
Stage III: GFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2 Stage IV: GFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2 Stage V: GFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or dialysis
B. Etiology
1. Children <5 years: Most commonly due to congenital abnormalities (e.g., kidney hypoplasia/dysplasia, urologic malformations).
2. Older children: More commonly acquired glomerular diseases (e.g., glo- merulonephritis, FSGS) or hereditary disorders (e.g., Alport syndrome).
C. Clinical Manifestations (Table 19.12)
D. General Management
1. Nutrition: Growth should be monitored closely; supplemental nutrition should be considered if not reaching caloric goals, which are higher in children with CKD. Potassium and sodium restriction may be required in advanced CKD. Growth hormone therapy may be considered in consultation with pediatric nephrology/endocrinology.
2. Anemia: Evaluate with CBC and iron studies. Iron deficiency is com- mon and should be treated with oral (preferred) or IV iron. Consider erythropoietin-stimulating agents in consultation with pediatric nephrology.
3. CKD-mineral and bone disorder: Characterized by phosphate retention, decreased free calcium, and decreased 1,25 hydroxyvitamin D. Serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone should be regularly monitored. Control phosphate with phos- phate binders, supplement with calcium and vitamin D, as indicated.
4. Cardiovascular: Regularly monitor blood pressure and lipid panel. Treating hypertension slows the progression of CKD.

 IX. DIALYSIS	
A. Indications for Acute Dialysis
When metabolic or fluid derangements are not controlled by aggressive medical management alone. Should be initiated in consultation with a nephrologist. Generally accepted criteria include the following:
1. Acidosis: Intractable metabolic acidosis.








Uremia	Decline in GFR
Sodium wasting	Solute diuresis, tubular damage Aldosterone resistance

Urinary concentrating defect	Solute diuresis, tubular damage
ADH resistance
Renal osteodystrophy	Impaired production of 1,25(OH) vitamin D Decreased intestinal calcium absorption Impaired phosphorus excretion Secondary hyperparathyroidism

Anemia	Decreased erythropoietin production
Low-grade hemolysis Bleeding, iron deficiency Decreased erythrocyte survival Inadequate folic acid intake Inhibitors of erythropoiesis

Infection	Defective granulocyte function
Glomerular loss of immunoglobulin/opsonins
Gastrointestinal ulceration	Gastric acid hypersecretion/gastritis
Reflux
Decreased motility
Hypertriglyceridemia	Diminished plasma lipoprotein lipase activity

Glucose intolerance	Tissue insulin resistance

2. Electrolyte abnormalities: Hyperkalemia >6.5 mEq/L despite restriction of delivery and medical management; calcium and phosphorus imbal- ance (e.g., hypocalcemia with tetany, seizures in the presence of a very high serum phosphate level); derangements implicated in neurologic abnormalities.
3. Ingestion or accumulation of dialyzable toxins or poisons: Lithium, ammonia, alcohol, barbiturates, ethylene glycol, isopropanol, methanol, salicylates, theophylline. Consult poison control experts when available.
4. Volume overload: Evidence of pulmonary edema or hypertension.
5. Uremia: BUN >150 mg/dL (lower if rising rapidly), uremic pericardial effusion, neurologic symptoms.
B. Techniques
1. Peritoneal dialysis (PD): Requires catheter to access peritoneal cav- ity, as well as adequate peritoneal perfusion. May be used acutely or chronically. Contraindications: Abdominal wall defects (omphalocele, gastroschisis, bladder exstrophy, diaphragmatic hernia), severe inflam- matory bowel disease, or infectious source in the abdomen.24
2. Intermittent hemodialysis (HD): Requires placement of special vascular access catheters. May be method of choice for certain toxins (e.g., ammonia, uric acid, poisons) or when there are contraindications to peritoneal dialysis.
3. Continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration/hemodialysis (CAVH/D) and continuous venovenous hemofiltration/hemodialysis (CVVH/D): Requires special vascular access catheter. Lower efficiency of solute removal com- pared with intermittent hemodialysis, but higher efficiency is not neces- sary because of the continuous nature of this form of dialysis. Sustained nature of dialysis allows for more gradual removal of volume/solutes, which is ideal for patients with hemodynamic or respiratory instability.
C. Complications
1. PD catheter leaks: Confirm leakage of PD fluid with glucose dipstick. Discontinue PD for 7 to 10 days or lower dialysate volume.
2. PD associated peritonitis (PDAP): Acute clouding of dialysate, abdominal pain/distention, vomiting. Culture peritoneal fluid and start empiric intra- peritoneal antibiotics in consultation with nephrology. Refer to published Consensus Guidelines for treatment recommendations.25
3. Intradialytic hypotension in HD: Causes include rapid fluid removal,
pre-dialysis antihypertensive medication, bradykinin release, hypotonic dialysate. Reduce or pause ultrafiltration.

3. RTA syndromes have a normal GFR and often do not progress to kidney failure.
4. Clinical presentation may be characterized by failure to thrive, polyuria, constipation, vomiting, and dehydration.
5. Fractional excretion of bicarbonate (FeHCO3) should be checked after a HCO3 load. Can help differentiate the types of RTA. See Section II.B for equation.
6. Urine anion gap (UAG) is also useful; however, it should not be used when a patient is volume depleted or has an anion-gap metabolic acido- sis. See Section II.B for equation.


B. Fanconi Syndrome
1. Generalized dysfunction of the proximal tubule resulting not only in bicarbonate loss but also in variable wasting of phosphate, glucose, and amino acids.
2. May be hereditary, as in cystinosis and galactosemia, or acquired through toxin injury and other immunologic factors.
3. Clinically characterized by rickets and impaired growth.
C. Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus
1. Water conservation is dependent on antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and its effects on the distal renal tubules. Polyuria (urine output >5 mL/kg/hr or >2 L/day), a hallmark of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), is due to diminished or lack of response of the ADH receptor in the distal renal tubules. Hereditary defects of ADH receptor or acquired insults (e.g., interstitial nephritis, sickle cell disease, lithium toxicity, CKD) may underlie NDI.
2. Must be differentiated from other causes of polyuria: Central diabetes insipidus (ADH deficiency that may be idiopathic or acquired through infection or pituitary trauma; see Chapter 10), diabetes mellitus, psy- chogenic polydipsia, cerebral salt wasting.

 XI. NEPHROLITHIASIS27-30	
A. Risk Factors
Male sex; history of UTI (especially those <5 years); congenital and struc- tural urologic abnormalities (urinary stasis), neurogenic bladder, hypercal- ciuria, hyperoxaluria/oxalosis, hypocitraturia, other metabolic abnormalities; family history of stones, renal failure, consanguinity.
B. Presentation
1. Microscopic hematuria (90%), flank/abdominal pain (50% to 75%), gross hematuria (30% to 55%), and concomitant UTI in up to 20%.
2. Have higher likelihood than adults of having asymptomatic stones, especially younger children.
C. Diagnostic Imaging
1. Ultrasonography is an effective and preferred modality, particularly at centers with expertise, given benefit of avoiding radiation exposure (75% sensitive for renal stones).29
2. Noncontrast CT may be preferred to improve diagnostic sensitivity (e.g., with radiolucent stones such as uric acid stones, ureteral stones, lack of ultrasonographic expertise).
D. Management
1. Pain control, urine culture, hydration. Some centers initiate a-blockers to facilitate stone passage, although evidence of benefit in children is equivocal.30-32


2. Antibiotics: Should be considered in treatment of all stones, especially if fever and/or pyuria present, because of the high association with UTI.
3. Urologic intervention (e.g., extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, ure- teroscopy, percutaneous nephrolithotomy): Consider with unremitting pain, urinary obstruction, increasing stone size, size =7 mm, or cystine/ struvite stone, especially in the setting of AKI or at-risk patients (e.g., solitary kidney, anatomic anomalies).32
4. Strain urine to collect stone; analyze stone composition to aid in preven- tion of future stones.
E. Workup
1. Up to 75% of children with a kidney stone will have a metabolic abnor- mality (e.g., hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hyperuricosuria, cystinuria).
2. Workup should include analysis of the stone (if possible); UA; basic metabolic panel; and serum calcium, phosphate, magnesium, and uric acid levels. If evidence of elevated calcium or phosphate, obtain para- thyroid hormone (PTH) level and consider checking 25- and 1,25(OH) vitamin D levels.
3. After symptoms have resolved, a 24-hour urine collection should be obtained. Risk factors for stone formation should be analyzed: urine volume, osmolarity, sodium, calcium, urate, oxalate, citrate, and cystine. This test is also referred to as a "stone risk analysis."
F. Prevention
1. All children with history of stones should increase fluid intake (e.g., at least 2 L/day in those aged >10 years old).
2. Targeted interventions of any identified metabolic abnormalities (e.g., low-sodium diet in those with hypercalciuria). Pharmacologic interventions are also available in certain scenarios (e.g., citrate supplementation).
3. Dietary Modifications: Long-term adherence (5 years) to normal cal- cium, low-sodium diet may decrease recurrence of stones in people with idiopathic hypercalciuria with recurrent nephrolithiasis.33

 I. NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION	
A. Mental Status
Alertness, orientation (person, place, time, situation), language, cognition
1. Infants: Observe "cuteness" and ability to dynamically engage caretakers.
2. Toddlers: Bring toys. Observe and engage in play.
3. School age: Ask children to draw or describe school or friends.
B. Cranial Nerves (Table EC 20.A)
1. For a quick assessment of cranial nerves for all patients, observe:
a. (II) Visual response to objects in each visual quadrant.
b. (III, IV, VI) Conjugate gaze at full lateral and vertical positions, nystagmus.
c. (VII) Symmetry and expressiveness of face at rest and with emotive activation.
d. (VIII) Finger rub, or response to and localization of sound for infants.
e. (IX, X, XII) Quality of phonation and articulation; ask about feeding, chewing, swallowing.
C. Motor
1. Muscle bulk: Atrophy is a red flag.
2. Tone: Spasticity, rigidity, hypotonia.
a. Infants: Observe infant undressed to assess resting posture (varies with age). Active tone: traction response, axillary stability (slip- through), posture in horizontal suspension. Passive tone (resistance of movements of the joints): flap hands/feet, scarf sign.
b. Red flags: Scissoring, toe-walking, inability to supinate hand, clasped thumb or grasp.
3. Strength:
a. Observe ease of normal functions: rising from floor, standing broad jump, running, climbing onto chair or exam table. Note presence of accommodations child is making in order to execute movements (e.g., shoulder shrug or trunk tilt to raise arm).
b. For conventional rating scale, see Box 20.1.
4. Involuntary movements: Fasciculations, tics, dystonia, chorea, athetosis, tremor.
D. Sensory
1. Primarily important if any concern for spinal cord defect or peripheral nerve injury.

2. Focus initial investigation along three axes for meaningful lesion localization:
a. Distal deficit with preserved (or less impaired) proximal sensation suggests polyneuropathy.
(1) Pain/temperature deficit: small fiber polyneuropathy/anterior spinal cord.
(2) Position/vibration deficit: large fiber polyneuropathy/posterior spinal cord.
b. Lower body more affected than upper body suggests spinal cord injuries.
(1) See Fig. 20.1 for dermatomes.
(2) Ask about continence.
c. If difference between left and right, concern for unilateral brain or spinal cord lesion.
E. Reflexes
1. Tendon Reflexes: Gradation (Box 20.2) and localization (Table EC 20.B). Helpful in localizing abnormalities including upper versus lower motor neuron pathology, especially in presence of weakness or asymmetry (Table EC 20.C). Compare right to left, upper to lower extremities, and distal to proximal reflexes. Generalized high or low reflexes of little significance in setting of normal strength and coordination.
2. Primitive reflexes: Expected during specific time windows (Table 20.1).
F. Coordination and Gait
1. Evaluate coordination while watching age-appropriate activities.
2. Tests for cerebellar function: Rapid alternating movements, finger-to- nose, heel-to-shin, walking, running.

 II. HEADACHES1-11	
A. Classification of Headaches
1. Primary headaches: Migraines, tension-type, cluster, trigeminal auto- nomic cephalgias (TACs), other primary headache disorders.
2. Secondary headaches: Trauma, infection, substance use or withdrawal, vas- cular disorder, neurologic disorder, increased intracranial pressure (ICP).
3. Differential diagnosis: Acute (Box 20.3) and chronic (Box 20.4)

B. Evaluation of Headaches
Obtain history (Box 20.5) and physical exam (Table EC 20.D); evaluate for red flags (Box 20.6). If red flags present, obtain appropriate imaging
(computed tomography [CT] for hemorrhage, magnetic resonance imaging/ angiography (MRI/MRA) for vascular abnormalities). Perform lumbar punc- ture (LP) if concern for subarachnoid hemorrhage (not detected on CT), infection, or increased ICP (Box 20.7). If no red flags present and normal neurologic exam, imaging and LP not recommended.

C. Migraine Headache
1. Migraines can be throbbing, pulsatile, or pressure-like in children. Usually bifrontal in children and unilateral in adolescents and adults. There are many potential triggers (e.g., stress, caffeine, menses, sleep disruption). See Box 20.8 for diagnostic criteria.
2. Classification1: With versus without aura. An aura is any neurologic symptom that occurs prior to onset of a migraine (e.g., visual aberra- tions, paresthesias, numbness, dysphasia).
3. Precursors to migraines and close associations: Cyclic vomiting, abdomi- nal migraines, paroxysmal vertigo of childhood, paroxysmal torticollis of infancy, and motion sickness.
4. Treatment: Combination of acute and prophylactic treatment.
a. Acute symptomatic: Avoid medication overuse (no more than 2 to 3 days/week); can lead to rebound headaches. Optimal acute therapy can prevent progression to chronic migraines.
b. Outpatient setting:
(1) Dark, quiet room and sleep.
(2) Acetaminophen and/or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g., naproxen, ibuprofen, ketorolac).
(3) Caffeine (e.g., coffee, tea, soda).
(4) Triptans: Not typically used in emergency room or inpatient setting (only effective at migraine onset). Limit use to twice per week.

(5) Antidopaminergics have antiemetic properties, though effective even if nausea is not a predominant factor. Prochlorperazine shown to be superior to metoclopramide.48 Sometimes more effective than NSAIDs in emergency department setting.
c. Emergency department (ED)/inpatient setting:
(1) Often helpful to combine medications and administer intravenous
(IV) "migraine cocktail" (see Fig. 20.2 for example ED algorithm).
(2) Steroids (e.g., methylprednisolone) may be useful in intractable cases, although evidence is lacking.
(3) Dihydroergotamine.

508	Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information


d. Preventative treatment:
(1) Lifestyle modification is mainstay. Adequate sleep,9 meals, hydra- tion, regular exercise. Avoid triggers, stress, caffeine withdrawal.
(2) Alternative/complementary therapies:
(a) Cognitive-behavioral therapy
(b) Biofeedback
(c) Physical therapy
(d) Acupuncture
(3) Consider prophylactic medications (Table EC 20.E) if migraines occurring more than once per week, affecting quality of life, frequent ED visits, complicated migraines, or migraines not responsive to abortive medications. Conflicting evidence regarding efficacy. Recent randomized controlled trial dem- onstrated that preventative medication was no more effective than placebo. New biologic (calcitonin gene-related peptide or CGRP)10,11 approved in adults in 2018; there are no published studies yet in pediatric population.

3. Febrile seizures12,13
a. Simple febrile seizure: Primary generalized seizure associated with fever in a child 6 to 60 months of age that is nonfocal, lasts for <15 minutes, and does not recur in a 24-hour period.
(1) Management: Identify the source of fever. No further workup (neuroimaging or electroencephalogram [EEG]) or antiseizure drugs are necessary for a simple febrile seizure in a well- appearing fully immunized child with a normal neurologic exami- nation and no meningeal signs.
(2) Indications for LP: Meningeal signs, incomplete or unknown Haemophilus influenzae or Streptococcus pneumoniae immu- nization status, or if pretreated with antibiotics (which can mask signs and symptoms of meningitis).

510	Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information


DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF RECURRENT EVENTS THAT MIMIC EPILEPSY IN CHILDHOOD20,50

Event	Differentiation from Epilepsy
SYNCOPE AND ANOXIC EVENTS

Vasovagal syncope	Triggers: Postural change, heat, emotion. Preceded by dizziness and
vision loss. Slow collapse to floor, may have brief confusion after event.

Cough syncope	Prolonged cough spasm during sleep in asthmatic, leading to loss of
consciousness, often with urinary incontinence.
BEHAVIORAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS
SLEEP-RELATED CONDITIONS
Narcolepsy	Excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (sudden atonia triggered by
emotion), sleep paralysis, sudden onset REM on EEG.
PAROXYSMAL MOVEMENT DISORDERS
Stereotypies (mannerisms) Repetitive movements or vocalizations (e.g., rocking, head banging).

MIGRAINE-ASSOCIATED DISORDERS


Paroxysmal vertigo
(toddler)

Episode of vertigo, vomiting, staggering, and falling in a child. May
become anxious, no loss of awareness.

MISCELLANEOUS EVENTS
Myoclonus	Involuntary muscle jerking or twitch

ECG, Electrocardiography; EEG, electroencephalography; GER, gastroesophageal reflux; REM, rapid eye movement.


b. Complex febrile seizure: Seizure associated with a fever that is focal, lasts for >15 minutes, or recurs within a 24-hour period.
Management: Identify the source of fever. Consider EEG, neuroimag- ing. Consider prescribing rectal diazepam for home emergency use. Slightly increased risk of developing epilepsy at later age.


4. Evaluation of unprovoked seizures
a. Rule out provocative factors: Obtain vitals. Consider checking glucose, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, complete blood cell count, toxicology screen.
b. EEG is recommended in all children with first unprovoked seizure to evaluate for an epilepsy syndrome, however it does not need to be emergently obtained.14 Interictal EEGs may be normal, particularly in children with focal seizures. Repeat EEGs, prolonged EEG monitoring with video as clinically indicated.
c. Imaging: High resolution MRI can assist with identification of under- lying brain malformation, although is not routinely indicated when evaluating a first-time seizure. CT scan is not recommended.
5. Epilepsy: Recurrent, unprovoked seizures or diagnosis of genetic syndrome characterized by recurrent seizures. Assess seizure type, epilepsy classification (Table EC 20.F),15-17 and severity of disorder. See Table 20.3 for selected epilepsy syndromes of childhood.
6. Breakthrough seizures: Assess for missed medications or significant weight gain, lack of sleep, stress, drugs/alcohol, physical exertion, ill- ness, dehydration, flickering lights, menses, and drug interactions that can lower seizure threshold (tricyclic antidepressants, certain antibiotics, over-the-counter cold preparations, diphenhydramine, herbal supple- ments). Obtain drug levels (see Table 20.4 for therapeutic drug levels).
7. Status epilepticus22: Traditionally defined as continuous seizure activity lasting approximately > 5 minutes or two discrete seizures without return of consciousness between them. See Chapter 1 for management.
8. Treatment19,20,23-25
a. First seizure, nonfocal, and with return to baseline: No antiseizure drug indicated. Overall recurrence approximately 50% in 2 to 5 years. Epileptiform abnormalities on EEG indicate a higher chance of recurrence.
b. Educate parents and patient regarding seizure safety.20 Review seizure first aid, including supervision during bathing or swimming. Be aware of driver's license laws in the state. Advocate teacher and school awareness.
c. Pharmacotherapy (see Table 20.4): Initiate if known etiology of sei- zure (diagnosis of epilepsy syndrome), recurrent unprovoked seizure (risk of recurrent seizure >80% after second unprovoked seizure). Choose therapy according to seizure type. Consider rectal diazepam if seizures are prolonged or hemodynamic instability.
d. Ketogenic diet25:
(1) High-fat, low-carbohydrate therapy typically used for intractable seizures.
(2) Should be managed by trained providers.
(3) Urine/serum ketones can be monitored to assess compliance.
(4) Side effects include transient GI upset and hyperlipidemia, chronic metabolic acidosis, kidney stones, fractures.

 IV. HYDROCEPHALUS26-28	
A. Etiology
Communicating (due to abnormal cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] reabsorption) versus noncommunicating (due to obstruction of CSF flow) and congenital versus acquired (postinfectious, posthemorrhagic, due to mass lesions).
B. Diagnosis
1. Clinical signs: apneas, bradycardias, macrocephaly, increasing head circumference (HC), bulging/tense fontanelle, splayed sutures, head- aches, blurry/spotty vision, decreased level of consciousness, "setting- sun" eye sign due to upward gaze paresis, vomiting, Cushing triad (hypertension, bradycardia, irregular respirations), papilledema, CN palsies (III, IV, VI).
2. In infants, obtain serial measurements of HC. Obtain neuroimaging if significant increase in HC percentile or if patient is symptomatic.
3. Imaging: Ultrafast MRI preferred to CT where available (see Chapter 26).
C. Treatment
1. Medical:
a. Emergently manage acute increase of ICP (see Chapter 1).
b. Slowly progressive hydrocephalus: Acetazolamide and furose- mide may provide temporary relief by decreasing the rate of CSF production.
2. Surgical: CSF shunting versus endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV).
a. Ventriculoperitoneal shunts used most commonly.
b. Patients with shunt dysfunction often present with signs of increased ICP. Causes include infection, obstruction (clogging or kinking), dis- connection, migration of proximal or distal tips, valve programming.
c. Evaluation of shunt integrity: See Chapter 26 for discussion of imag- ing. Consult pediatric neurosurgery (if available).

B. Differential Diagnosis of Acute Ataxia (Box 20.9)
C. Evaluation (Box 20.10)


BOX 20.9
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF ACUTE ATAXIA
1. Ingestion (e.g., antiseizure drugs, antipsychotics, sedatives, hypnotics) or intoxication (e.g., alcohol, hydrocarbon fumes, heavy metals)
2. Postinfectious: cerebellitis (e.g., viral causes), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis
3. Head trauma: cerebellar contusion or hemorrhage, posterior fossa hema- toma, vertebrobasilar dissection, postconcussion syndrome
4. Basilar migraine
5. Benign paroxysmal vertigo
6. Intracranial mass lesion: tumor, vascular malformation
7. Opsoclonus-myoclonus ataxia syndrome: Chaotic eye movements combined with ataxia and myoclonus. Postinfectious or paraneoplastic (neuroblastoma/neural crest tumors) etiology.
8. Hydrocephalus
9. Infection: labyrinthitis, abscess
10. Seizure: ictal or postictal
11. Vascular events: cerebellar hemorrhage or stroke
12. Guillain-Barré syndrome or Miller-Fisher variant (ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and areflexia). Warning: If bulbar signs present, patient may lose ability to protect airway.
13. Rare inherited paroxysmal ataxias
14. Inborn errors of metabolism
15. Multiple sclerosis
16. Somatic symptom disorder



CT, Computed tomography; EEG, electroencephalogram; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging.

 VI. STROKE31-33	
A. Pediatric Stroke
50% ischemic, 50% hemorrhagic. Presents similarly to stroke mimics, but less common and frequently missed (Box 20.11). Neonatal stroke
frequently presents with nonfocal symptoms: seizures, altered level of con- sciousness, feeding difficulties. Important to consider stroke on differential of acute neurologic changes.



PRES, Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.


B. Etiologies Vary by Age (Table EC 20.G)31
Patients with increased risk of recurrent stroke: history of cardiac disease and cardiac surgery, cerebral arteriopathy, sickle cell disease, thrombophilias.
C. Management
1. Stroke team activation (where available) or urgent neurology consulta- tion, along with transfer to a tertiary care center with expertise in child- hood stroke.
2. Supportive care and neurologic monitoring. Maintain normoglycemia, maintain normothermia (avoid fevers). Monitor for signs of increased ICP.
3. Optimize cerebral perfusion pressure: Ensure adequate fluid volume and maintenance of median blood pressure (BP) for age, allow permissive hypertension.
4. Reperfusion therapies: Not routinely recommended in children due to lack of evidence, but an active area of research. Thrombolytic therapy with IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or mechanical thrombectomy may be considered under appropriate circumstances in centers with extensive pediatric stroke experience (American Heart Association guidelines).
5. Children with sickle cell disease: Consult a hematologist. Hydration and emergent exchange transfusion to reduce sickle hemoglobin to <30% (see Chapter 14).

 VII. ENCEPHALOPATHY/ALTERED MENTAL STATUS34-37	
A. Definitions
1. Encephalopathy: Diffuse neuronal dysfunction manifesting as acute or chronic altered mental status.

B. Selected Causes of Encephalopathy (Box 20.12)
C. Diagnosis
Targeted based on clinical scenario and associated symptoms. See Chapter 1 for emergency management of acute altered level of consciousness. Further workup based on suspected etiology. May require serum and/or cerebrospi- nal fluid (CSF) studies for infectious/inflammatory/metabolic markers, EEG, neuroimaging (e.g., MRI or PET).
D. Treatment
Dependent on etiology. See Chapter 1 for emergency management of acute altered level of consciousness. See Chapter 17 for treatment of meningitis.

 VIII. NEUROMUSCULAR DISORDERS38-45	
A. Spinal Muscular Atrophy38,39
1. Etiology: Motor neuron degeneration caused by autosomal recessive mutations in SMN1 gene with resulting insufficient levels of SMN pro- tein. Severity correlates inversely with copy number of SMN2.
2. Clinical features: Varying degrees of symmetric and progressive, proximal more than distal, muscle weakness with preserved cognition. Patients with severe forms do not survive past early childhood without treatment due to respiratory failure.
3. Treatment: Evaluation of weak/hypotonic infant for possible spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is urgent, as effective treatment (nusinersen [Spinraza]) is possible, but magnitude of benefit decreases with time.


B. Duchenne or Becker Muscular Dystrophy40
1. Etiology: X-linked mutation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene, encoding dystrophin, causes disruption of muscular cytoskel- eton. Mostly affects males. Duchenne form is more severe and caused by complete disruption of dystrophin; partial disruption causes milder Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD).
2. Clinical features: Delayed motor milestones. Progressive proximal sym- metric muscle weakness starting in early childhood leading to wheel- chair use for mobility by age 13. Elevated serum CK levels.
3. Treatment: Corticosteroids (prednisone or deflazacort [Emflaza]) are mainstays.41 Requires multidisciplinary management: At high risk for cardiomyopathy and respiratory and orthopedic complications. Novel disease-modifying agent, eteplirsen (Exondys 51), limited to patients with specific DMD mutations.
C. Myasthenia Gravis42
1. Etiology: Autoantibodies binding the acetylcholine receptor impair neuromuscular junction function. Subtypes include transient neonatal myasthenia (due to transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies from mother with myasthenia), congenital myasthenic syndrome (genetic defects of neuromuscular junction proteins), and juvenile (classic auto- immune in children).
2. Clinical features: A key feature is fatigable, variable weakness. Often concentrates in orbital muscles (double vision, ptosis, ophthalmopare- sis), or bulbar weakness (slurred/nasal voice, difficulty chewing, swal- lowing, talking). Can also manifest with generalized weakness of limbs and trunk. Triggers include illness, fever, heat, and some medications. Bulbar weakness can worsen with illness and compromised airway. A good bedside test of bulbar muscle fatigue is the "slurp test."43 Ask patient to imbibe four ounces of water through a straw quickly-if con- sumption slows after 1 or 2 ounces, at risk of bulbar decompensation; if marked slowing or times especially prolonged, at risk for respiratory failure.
3. Treatment: Refer to/consult specialist for management.
a. Myasthenic crisis/rapid onset of symptoms: plasmapheresis, IVIG, and IV neostigmine. Evaluate the need to secure definitive airway.
b. Chronic management:
(1) Oral pyridostigmine
(2) Prednisone (caution about paradoxical worsening with any large initial dose)
(3) Immunosuppressive medications (e.g., mycophenolate, rituximab)
(4) Thymectomy may be helpful
D. Acute Guillain-Barré Syndrome44,45
1. Etiology: Presumed immune attack against peripheral nerve myelin. In some cases, triggered by illness, notably Campylobacter jejuni infection.


2. Clinical features and diagnosis: Rapid decline with nadir less than two weeks after onset; respiratory status can be compromised. Back pain often prominent in children. Often with autonomic instability. Elevated spinal fluid protein without cellular infiltrate ("albumocytologic dissocia- tion"). Nerve conduction studies can be helpful.
3. Treatment: Patients should be hospitalized at presentation to monitor for respiratory stability. Acute phase treatment with IVIG, plasmapheresis helpful if initiated early. Supportive care.
4. Variants of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)
a. Acute: Miller Fisher syndrome (ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and are- flexia), acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN)
b. Chronic: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a similar but slower progressive autoimmune disorder that often requires chronic immunosuppressive therapy.
E. Infantile Botulism46
1. Etiology: Affects infants <1 year of age, most commonly <6 months, due to colonization of colon by Clostridium botulinum bacteria (infants are susceptible due to immaturity of gut flora). Botulinum toxin released into bloodstream, irreversibly cleaves protein complex necessary for acetylcholine vesicle release into neuromuscular junction.
2. Clinical features and diagnosis: Subacute onset weakness of skeletal muscles diffusely, concentrating in eye, face, and bulbar muscles early. Weak pupil constriction responses common and specific when present. Presenting symptom often constipation for days to weeks before onset of weakness, poor feeding, and weak cry. At high risk for respiratory failure due to respiratory and bulbar muscle weakness. Tachycardia
is common. Confirmation of diagnosis by toxin assay of stool (not culture) performed by state lab or CDC; may use minimal amount of sterile, nonbacteriostatic water colonic enema for specimen collec- tion. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies can help confirm diagnosis.
3. Treatment: Assess and stabilize airway: approximately 50% of infants require intubation/advanced airway. Treat with one-time dose of human botulism immune globulin (BabyBIG or BIG-IV), available through Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program (http://www.infantbotulis m.org/). Prompt treatment is key; do not wait for confirmatory testing. With appropriate treatment, prognosis for full recovery is excellent. See Chapter 16 for recommended interval before measles or varicella vac- cination after botulism immune globulin administration.

 I. ASSESSMENT OF GROWTH	
A. Types of Growth Charts
1. Child <24 months: World Health Organization (WHO) international growth charts1
2. Child =2 years: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
growth charts2
3. Growth charts for premature infants
a. Corrected age = infant's chronologic age - number of weeks of pre- maturity (using 40 weeks as full-term gestation) and should be used up to 3 years.3,4
b. Chronologic age should be used if child's growth "catches up" before 3 years.5
c. Oslen, Bertino, and Fenton growth charts can be used to assess growth in premature infants up to 41 weeks (Oslen) to 50 weeks (Fenton).6 After 4 to 8 weeks post-term, the WHO growth chart can be used.7
d. The choice of growth chart has some variability across practice sites and preferences.8
4. Special populations9,10
a. WHO or CDC growth charts are recommended in all cases due to limited reference data for condition-specific growth charts.
b. Condition-specific growth charts can show families how a specific condition can alter growth potential.
c. Growth charts have been created for Down syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, Williams syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Turner syndrome, and Marfan syndrome.
B. Interpretation of Growth Charts11,12
1. Stunting/short stature: Length or height <5th percentile
2. Underweight:
a. Children <2 years: Weight for length/height <5th percentile
b. Children =2 years: Body mass index (BMI) for age <5th percentile or BMI <18.5 kg/m2
3. Healthy weight: BMI for age 5th percentile to <85th percentile or BMI
18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2
4. Overweight:
a. Children <2 years: Weight for length/height >95th percentile


b. Children =2 years: BMI for age = 85th to <95th percentile or BMI 25 to 29.9 kg/m2
5. Obese:
a. Children <2 years: No consensus definition exists
b. Children =2 years: BMI for age =95th percentile or BMI =30 kg/m2
C. General Guidelines Regarding Appropriate Growth13,14
1. Term infants usually lose approximately 5% to 10% of their birth weight, but regain the weight within 2 weeks.
2. Infants should gain 20 to 30 g/day from birth to 3 months, 15 to 22 g/
day from 3 to 9 months, and 6 to 11 g/day from 9 to 12 months.
3. Term infants double their birth weight in 4 to 5 months and triple it by 1 year of age.
4. Height doubles from birth to age 3 to 4 years of age.
5. The average size of a 4-year-old is 40 in. and 35 lb.
6. From age 3 to 10 years of age, children grow an average of 2.5 inches per year.

 II. MANAGEMENT OF OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE CHILDREN	
A. AAP Recommendations for the Prevention of Obesity15-17
1. Exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months of age and then breastfeeding maintenance until at least 12 months.
2. Daily breakfast and family meal times.
3. Limit sugary beverages, fast food, energy-dense foods, and encourage fruits and vegetables.
4. Develop a family media plan with limits and technology-free zones. For infants less than 18 months, no media other than video chatting.
If media used with toddlers 18-24 months, parents should watch and engage with children during use. For children 2 to 5 years, a max of one hour of high-quality programming a day with co-viewing when possible.
5. Recommend 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous exercise per day.
B. Prevention and Management of Obesity in the Primary Care Setting (Table 21.1)
C. Conditions Associated with Obesity15
1. Endocrine:
a. Polycystic ovarian syndrome
b. Precocious puberty
c. Pre-diabetes/Type 2 diabetes
2. Gastrointestinal:
a. Cholelithiasis
b. Gastroesophageal reflux
c. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
3. Neurologic: Pseudotumor cerebri
4. Orthopedic:
a. Blount disease
b. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE)


5. Behavioral health:
a. Anxiety
b. Binge eating disorder
c. Depression


MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING STRATEGIES FOR CHILDREN BASED ON BODY MASS INDEX50-52
BMIInitial ManagementMonitoring-Follow upNormal BMI Praise child and familyNext well child visit Screen for genetic dyslipidemiawith nonfasting lipid profilebetween ages 9-11 and 18-21 Maintain weight velocityNormal BMI that is increasing Screen for genetic dyslipidemia asNext well child visitpercentiles (crossing twoabovepercentile lines is a risk Patient educationfactor for obesity)Overweight BMI Patient education2-4 weeks If health risk factors, obtain fast-ing glucose, hemoglobin A1c ororal glucose tolerance test, lipidprofile, ALT, and ASTObese BMI Patient education2-4 weeks Obtain fasting glucose, hemoglo-bin A1c or oral glucose tolerancetest, lipid profile, ALT, and AST Some specialist clinics screen forvitamin D deficiency and insulinresistance (i.e., measure fastinginsulin), but their clinical utilityand cost effectiveness is unclear No guidelines on which age to startlaboratory screening, but someexperts start at 2 years of age Consider other labs (e.g., thyroidstudies, cortisol) based on clini-cal pictureFurther follow-up and management for those who are overweight or obese:
(a) At each follow-up, record weight, measure blood pressure, and use an empathetic and empowering counseling style (e.g., motivational interviewing).
(b) Establish goals: Positive behavior change, weight maintenance, or decrease in BMI velocity. Children aged 2 to 5 years who have obesity should not lose more than 1 pound/month; older children and adolescents with obesity should not lose more than an average of 2 pounds/week.
(c) If no improvement after 3 to 6 months, refer to structured weight management program. If no improvement after 3 to 6 months, the next step is a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach. If no improvement, refer for evaluation at a tertiary care center for medication management and weight reduction surgery.

 III. MALNUTRITION IN INFANTS AND CHILDREN	
A. Defining Malnutrition16
NOTE: Also called growth failure or under-nutrition; previously called failure to thrive.
1. Condition of under-nutrition generally identified in the first 3 years of life
2. Can be described by the following growth scenarios:
a. Primary indicators when single data point available
(1) Weight for length/height z-score
(2) BMI for age z-score
(3) Length/height for age z-score
(4) Wasting or mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC)
(5) Presence of nutritional edema
b. Primary indicators when two or more data points available
(1) Weight gain velocity (<2 years old)
(2) Degree of weight loss (2 to 20 years of age)
(3) Deceleration in weight for length/height z-score
(4) Inadequate nutrient intake
B. Classifying the Degree to Which a Patient Is Malnourished (Table 21.2)17
1. Acute (duration <3 months)
2. Chronic or stunting (duration >3 months); suggested by height/length for age
C. Resources for Determining Z-scores18
1. PediTools (peditools.org)
2. Standardized height and weight calculator (https://www.quesgen.com/ BMIPedsCalc.php).

4. WHO website (who.int/childgrowth/standards/chart_catalogue)
D. Differential Diagnosis of Malnutrition19
1. Secondary to disease/injury
2. Decreased intake (e.g., fluid restriction, cardiac failure, anorexia ner- vosa, food insecurity)
3. Increased requirement/hyper-metabolism (e.g., burns)
4. Excessive loss (e.g., chronic diarrhea, burn, proteinuria)
5. Malabsorption (e.g., Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis)
E. Physical Exam Findings Consistent with Malnutrition23-25
1. Fat loss (e.g., orbital, buccal, triceps, ribs)
2. Muscle wasting (e.g., temporalis, pectoralis, deltoid, latissimus dorsi, quadriceps)
3. Edema
4. Functional limitations (e.g., hand grip strength)
5. Macronutrient deficiencies
a. Iron
(1) Exam findings: Koilonychias, pale conjunctiva and nail beds
(2) Risk factors: Low birth weight, feeding problems, poor growth, exclusive breast feeding >6 months
b. Vitamin C
(1) Exam findings: Perifollicular hemorrhage, scorbutic tongue, bleeding gum, bruising
(2) Risk factors: Limited diet, infant on cow's milk, dialysis, malabsorption
c. Vitamin A
(1) Exam findings: Bitot spot, follicular hyperkeratosis
(2) Risk factors: Limited diet, fat malabsorption, alcoholism, cystic fibrosis, short bowel
d. Vitamin B6
(1) Exam findings: Seborrheic dermatitis, angular palpebritis, hyper- trophied papillae
(2) Risk factors: Dialysis, sickle cell disease, malabsorption; diuretic, anticonvulsant, contraceptive, and isoniazid use
e. Zinc
(1) Exam findings: Dermatitis, vesico-bullous lesions, diaper rash
(2) Risk factors: Prematurity, parenteral nutrition (PN), cholestasis, diarrhea, high phytate intake, celiac or Crohn's disease, AIDS, liver or renal disease, alcoholism, trauma, burn, sleeve gastrec- tomy, diuretic and valproate use
F. Diagnostic Evaluation of Malnutrition26-29
1. There is no consensus on work-up algorithm.
2. Routine labs and imaging are often low yield and generally not recom- mended; work-up should be guided by clinical suspicion.
3. If warranted, reasonable initial testing could include complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, urinalysis, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.


4. If the child's length has decelerated and is below 50%, can screen for hypothyroidism and growth hormone deficiency.
5. If recurrent or severe upper respiratory or opportunistic infections, consider testing for human immunodeficiency and tuberculosis and measuring immunoglobulin and complement levels.
6. Based on clinical suspicion, can consider celiac screening, sweat chlo- ride testing, echocardiogram, hepatitis serology, stool studies.
7. Consider hospitalization for observed feeding if the child fails outpatient management, suspicion for abuse/neglect or traumatic injury, severe psychological caregiver impairment, serious malnutrition, or at risk for re-feeding.
G. Red Flags That Suggest a Medical Cause of Malnutrition20
1. Developmental delay or dysmorphic features
2. Cardiac findings (e.g., murmur, edema, jugular venous distension)
3. Failure to gain weight despite adequate calories
4. Organomegaly or lymphadenopathy
5. Recurrent or severe respiratory, mucocutaneous, or urinary infections
6. Recurrent vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration
H. Approach to the Management of Malnourished Patients21,22 (Box 21.1)
1. Address the etiology of malnutrition.
2. Approximately 20% to 30% more energy may be required to achieve catch-up growth in children. This should continue until the previous growth percentiles are regained.
3. Catch-up linear growth may lag several months behind weight.
4. See Box 21.1 for instructions on the calculation of catch-up growth requirements.

5. Screen for food insecurity and offer social work and community resources.
6. Pharmacotherapy (e.g., cyproheptadine, megestrol) may be helpful for patients with significant underlying diseases (e.g., cancer, cystic fibrosis).

 IV. RE-FEEDING SYNDROME	
A. Patients at Risk of Developing Re-Feeding Syndrome23
1. Chronic malnutrition (e.g., prolonged fasting =5 days, malignancy)
2. Renal/endocrine (e.g., chronic diuretic use, diabetic hyperglycemic
hyperosmolar syndrome)
3. Gastrointestinal loss (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, chronic pancre- atitis, short bowel)
4. Infectious (e.g., AIDS, tuberculosis)
5. Cardiac (e.g., congenital heart disease)
6. Pulmonary (e.g., cystic fibrosis)
7. Psychiatric (e.g., anorexia nervosa, chronic alcohol use)
8. Social (e.g., child abuse/neglect, homelessness, food insecurity)
B. Management of Re-Feeding Syndrome24
1. Maintain continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring or check vital signs every 4 hours, depending on level of concern.
2. Ensure strict intake and output monitoring with calorie count and daily weights.
3. Obtain at least daily basic metabolic panel with phosphorous and magnesium. Obtain more frequently if electrolyte replacement needed, or if there are concerning trends.
4. Measure pre-albumin, albumin, zinc.
5. Consider giving thiamine 100 to 300 mg PO daily (or 50 to 100 mg IV) × 3 days before feeding. There is some debate whether this is required.
6. Give a multivitamin daily.
7. Feeding should not proceed without appropriate supplementation.
8. Recommendations vary, but start at 1/4 to 1/2 of estimated caloric needs depending on degree of risk.
9. Dietary advancement over 3 to 7 days with caloric increases of 10% to 25% per day until recommended caloric goals achieved.
10. Enteral feeding is preferred over parenteral feeding.

VITAMIN D LABATORY INTERPRETATION
25-Hydroxy Vitamin D	Value (ng/mL)

Deficiency	<10-20
Optimal level	? 30a

aCut-off values are not yet well-defined. Controversy exists regarding the optimal 25-hydroxy vitamin D level. Some experts recommend a level of 20 to 30 ng/mL as being sufficient. These are the Johns Hopkins Hospital Pediatrics guidelines used for dosing.
NOTE: 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D is the physiologically active form, but 25-hydroxy vitamin D is the value to monitor for vitamin D deficiency as it approximates body stores of vitamin D.

e. At risk children (e.g., cystic fibrosis) and those with labora-
tory confirmed vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency should also be supplemented.
f. See Table 21.6 for interpreting vitamin D levels.
2. Folate27,28
a. All women capable of becoming pregnant should consume 400 mCg from supplements or diet.
b. This should continue as women enter prenatal care.
c. If a woman had a prior pregnancy with a neutral tube defect and is planning another pregnancy, she should consume 4 mg of folic
acid daily (requires a prescription) at least 4 weeks before becoming pregnant and continue through the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.
D. Mineral Requirements (Table 21.7)
1. Iron29
a. Breast-fed term infants should receive 1 mg/kg/day of an oral iron supplement beginning at 4 months of age, preferably from iron- fortified cereal or, alternatively, elemental iron.
b. Breast-fed preterm infants should receive 2 mg/kg/day by 1 month of age, which should continue until the infant is weaned to iron-fortified formula or begins eating complementary foods.
c. Formula-fed term infants receive adequate iron from fortified formula.
d. Formula-fed preterm infants need 2 mg/kg/day, which is the amount supplied by iron-fortified formulas.
2. Fluoride30
a. Consider fluoride supplementation for those patients who use bottled water or home filtration systems. Some home water treatment sys- tems can reduce fluoride levels.
b. For infants and children at high risk for the development of caries, fluoride supplementation ranging from 0.25-1 mg/day is recom- mended according to the American Dental Association's schedule.
c. Fluoridated toothpaste is recommended for all children starting at tooth eruption, using a smear (grain-of-rice-sized) until age 3 and then a pea-sized amount after that time.

RDAs and AIs may both be used as goals for individual intake. RDAs are set to meet the needs of almost all (97% to 98%) individuals in a group. For healthy breast-fed infants, the AI is the mean intake. The AI for other life stage and gender groups is believed to cover needs of all individuals in the group, but lack of data or uncertainty in the data prevent from being able to specify with confidence the percentage of individuals covered by this intake.

E. Fiber Requirements (Table 21.8)

A. Benefits of Breast Milk31
1. Decreased risk of infections (e.g., otitis media, respiratory), necrotizing enterocolitis, inflammatory bowel, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
2. Decreased incidence of atopic conditions, obesity, and diabetes.
B. Contraindications to Breastfeeding32,33 (Box 21.2)
1. Tobacco smoking is not contraindicated but is strongly discouraged because of an association with increased risks of SIDS, respiratory disease, and infections in exposed infants.
2. Alcohol should be limited to the occasional intake of 2 oz of liquor, 8 oz of wine, or two beers for the average 60 kg woman >2 hours prior to the onset of nursing.
3. Methadone and buprenorphine are not contraindications, if the mother is in a stable maintenance program and not using street drugs.
C. Use of Milk Bank Donor Human Milk34
1. Most commonly used in low birth weight infants (<1.5 kg).
2. Can be considered in infants with intestinal disease with documented intolerance to specialized infant formulas.
D. Safe Handling of Breast Milk35
1. Freshly expressed or pumped milk can be stored at room temperature for up to 4 hours, in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, in the freezer for approximately 6 months (up to 12 months), and in an insulated cooler bag with frozen packs up to 24 hours while traveling.
2. Once breast milk is thawed to room temperature or warmed, it should be used within 2 hours.

INITIATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF PARENTERAL NUTRITION FOR INFANTS THROUGH ADOLESCENTSa,b
NutrientInitial DoseAdvancementGoalsGlucose3.5%-10%1%-5%/day5-12 (max 14-18) mg/kg/min rate of infusionProtein0.8-3 g/kg/day1 g/kg/day0.8-4 g/kg/day
10%-16% of caloriesFatc1-2 g/kg/day0.5-1 g/kg/day1-3.5 g/kg/dayd
0.17 g/kg/hr (maximum rate ofinfusion)aAcceptable osmolarity of parenteral nutrition through a peripheral line varies between 900 and 1050 osm/L by institu- tion. An estimate of the osmolarity of parenteral nutrition can be obtained with the following formula: Estimated osmolar- ity = (dextrose concentration × 50) + (amino acid concentration × 100) + (mEq of electrolytes × 2). Consult individual pharmacy for hospital limitations.
bIn general, infants require the higher concentration and/or rate of glucose, protein, and fat compared to older children and adolescents
cEssential fatty acid deficiency may occur in fat-free parenteral nutrition within 2 to 4 weeks in infants and children and as early as 2 to 14 days in neonates. A minimum of 2% to 4% of total caloric intake as linoleic acid and 0.25% to 0.5% as linolenic acid is necessary to meet essential fatty acid requirements.
dIf parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis occurs, lipid minimization and/or use of fish oil or composite lipids should be considered.41

2. Leading cause of childhood cancer deaths.
3. Highest incidence in infants and children under 5 years old.
B. Clinical Presentation
1. Early/generalized symptoms: Headache, lethargy/fatigue, nausea/ emesis, gait abnormalities; increased head circumference in infants
2. Later symptoms related to tumor location: Seizures, altered language, encephalopathy, hemiplegia/hemi-sensory deficit, facial weakness, neu- roendocrine effects (precocious/delayed puberty, diabetes insipidus), visual changes, abnormal movements, back pain, sphincter disturbance


C. Initial Workup
1. Thorough neurologic exam, including fundoscopic exam.
2. Neurosurgery/Neuro-oncology consultation.
3. Labs: Presurgical tests (complete blood count [CBC], electrolytes, blood type, coagulation factors, cross-matching); endocrine tests for suprasel- lar tumors; a fetoprotein (AFP) and ß human chorionic gonadotropin (ß hCG) if germinoma suspected.
4. Imaging: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain (sometimes spine) with and without intravenous (IV) contrast.
D. Management Principles
1. High-dose dexamethasone: Often administered to reduce tumor- associated edema.
2. Consider seizure prophylaxis for those at high risk of seizures or seizure history.

 V. ONCOLOGIC EMERGENCIES2,9-16	
A. Fever and Neutropenia (Fig 22.1)
1. Etiology: Fever with temperature =38.3°C (some centers and medical associations also use 38.0°C sustained over an hour to define fever) in the setting of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <500 cells/µL or <1000 cells/µL but expected to drop to <500 cells/µL in the next 48 hours). Presumed serious infection in a neutropenic host. While fevers may be caused by other etiologies including medications, presume infection until proven otherwise.
2. Presentation: May appear ill with fatigue, lethargy, or localized pain. Can also appear well, yet have subtle signs of compensated shock, including chills, rigors, tachypnea, or tachycardia. May deteriorate after initial doses of antibiotics.
3. Management: Broad-spectrum antibiotics with antipseudomonal cover- age should be administered within 60 minutes of presentation to medi- cal facility. Note: Antibiotic administration may lead to clinical sepsis secondary to release of endotoxin from gram-negative bacteria.
B. Hyperleukocytosis/Leukostasis
1. Etiology: Elevated white blood cell (WBC) count (usually >100,000/µL) in leukemia patients leads to leukostasis in the microcirculation and diminished tissue perfusion (notably in CNS and lungs). Leukostasis occurs more commonly and at lower WBC counts in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) than in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL).
2. Presentation: Hypoxia, tachypnea, dyspnea, and pulmonary hemorrhage from pulmonary leukostasis. Mental status changes, headaches, seizures, and papilledema from cerebral leukostasis. May also see GI bleeding, abdominal pain, renal insufficiency, priapism, and/or intracranial hemorrhage. Hyperleukocytosis may be asymptomatic.

3. Management
a. Prompt initiation of chemotherapy is the most effective approach.
b. Consider leukapheresis or exchange transfusion if evidence of symp- tomatic leukostasis.
c. Transfuse platelets to keep count above 20,000/µL to prevent
hemorrhage.1
d. Avoid red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, which raise viscosity. If required, consider partial exchange transfusion.
e. Hydration and allopurinol should be initiated, as hyperleukocytosis increases the risk of tumor lysis syndrome.
f. Treat coagulopathy.
C. Tumor Lysis Syndrome
1. Etiology: Rapid lysis of tumor cells releases intracellular contents into the blood stream spontaneously before treatment or during early stages of chemotherapy (especially Burkitt lymphoma, T-cell leukemia/lym- phoma, acute leukemias with hyperleukocytosis).
2. Presentation: Hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia (with sec- ondary hypocalcemia). Can lead to acute kidney injury. Symptoms include nausea, anorexia, arrhythmias, seizures, and altered mental status.
3. Diagnosis: CBC, basic metabolic panel (BMP), phosphorus, uric acid, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), electrocardiogram (ECG).
4. Prevention and Management
a. Hydration: Dextrose-containing IV fluids (without potassium, calcium, phosphate) at twice maintenance rate. Keep urine-specific gravity
<1.010 and urine output >100 mL/m2/hr. Alkalinization is no longer recommended, given increased risk of calcium phosphate precipitation.
b. Hyperuricemia: Allopurinol inhibits formation of uric acid and should only be given PO (see Formulary for dosing). Rasburicase converts uric acid to the more soluble allantoin. Use in high-risk patients, especially those with uric acid >7.5 mg/dL. Do not use rasburi-
case with patients with known G6PD deficiency, as it may result in methemoglobinemia.
c. Monitor potassium, calcium, phosphorous, uric acid, and urinalysis closely (up to Q2 hours for high-risk patients). There is an increased risk of calcium phosphate precipitation when Ca × Phos > 60. Consider early use of sevelamer.
d. See Chapter 11 for management of abnormal electrolytes and Chapter 19 for dialysis indications.
D. Spinal Cord Compression
1. Etiology: Intrinsic or extrinsic compression of spinal cord. Occurs most commonly with metastases from brain tumors, spinal tumors, soft tissue sarcomas, neuroblastoma, lymphoma.
2. Presentation: Back pain (localized or radicular), weakness, sensory loss, bowel or bladder dysfunction, gait abnormalities. Prognosis for recovery based on duration and level of disability at presentation.


3. Diagnosis: MRI (preferred) or computed tomography (CT) scan of spine. Spine radiography is less sensitive.
4. Management
a. In the presence of neurologic abnormalities, strong history, and rapid progression of symptoms, consider immediate dexamethasone. Note: Steroids may prevent accurate diagnosis of leukemia/lymphoma; plan diagnostic procedure as soon as possible.
b. If tumor type is known and chemosensitive, emergent chemotherapy is indicated.
c. If tumor type is unknown or debulking may remove most/all of tumor, emergent neurosurgery consultation is indicated to decompress the spine.
E. Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP)
1. Etiology: Ventricular obstruction or impaired cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) flow. Most commonly seen with brain tumors, but also with intracranial hemorrhage, thrombosis, meningeal involvement by tumor or infection.
2. Presentation: Headaches, altered mental status, irritability, lethargy, nuchal rigidity, emesis, abnormal vision; Cushing triad and pupillary changes are late and ominous findings.
3. Diagnosis
a. Evaluate for vital sign changes [i.e., Cushing triad (? heart rate, ?
systolic blood pressure, irregular respirations)].
b. Funduscopic evaluation for papilledema.
c. Obtain CT or MRI of the head (MRI more sensitive for diagnosis of posterior fossa tumors).
4. Management
a. See Chapter 1 for management principles.
b. Obtain emergent neurosurgical consultation.
c. If tumor is the cause, start IV dexamethasone (see Formulary for dosing).
F. Other Neurologic Emergencies: Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA), Seizures
1. CVA Etiology: Hyperleukocytosis, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, radi- ation (fibrosis) or chemotherapy-related (e.g., l-asparaginase-induced hemorrhage or thrombosis, methotrexate). Most common in patients with AML or any form of leukemia with hyperleukocytosis.
2. Seizure Etiology: Most common in primary CNS tumors, tumors meta- static to CNS, meningeal leukemia, chemotherapy-related (intrathecal [IT] cytarabine, IT/IV methotrexate).
3. See Chapters 1 and 20 for diagnosis and management.
G. Superior Vena Cava Syndrome/Superior Mediastinal Syndrome
1. Etiology: Compression of venous drainage and trachea, most commonly caused by mediastinal mass. Usually seen with T-lymphoblastic lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, mature B-cell lymphoma, and germ cell tumors.
2. Presentation: Dyspnea, cough, wheeze, stridor, orthopnea, headaches, facial swelling, dizziness, plethora.


3. Diagnosis: Two-view chest radiograph. If mediastinal mass present, obtain neck radiograph to further assess. Avoid sedation if unstable, high risk for airway obstruction.
4. Management
a. Control airway, place in upright position, and administer supplemen- tal oxygen.
b. Biopsy (e.g., bone marrow, pleurocentesis, lymph node biopsy) before therapy if patient can tolerate sedation.
c. Empiric therapy: Radiotherapy, steroids, chemotherapy. Note: can confound diagnosis.
H. Typhlitis (Neutropenic Enterocolitis)
1. Etiology: Inflammation of bowel wall, typically localized to cecum. Associated with bacterial or fungal invasion. Associated with prolonged neutropenia, often secondary to induction therapy in leukemia.
2. Presentation: Right lower quadrant abdominal pain, nausea/emesis, diarrhea, fever (may be absent early in course). Risk for perforation.
3. Diagnosis
a. Careful serial abdominal examinations.
b. Abdominal ultrasound may be considered (may show pneumatosis intestinalis, bowel wall edema). CT abdomen with IV and PO contrast is most sensitive form of imaging.
4. Management
a. Bowel rest: NPO on IV fluids; consider nasogastric decompression.
b. Broad anerobic and gram-negative antibiotic coverage.
c. Surgical consultation.
I. Cytokine Release Syndrome
1. Etiology: Newer immunologic agents (e.g., chimeric antigen receptor T [CAR-T] therapy and specific antibodies) can provoke release of cytokines associated with systemic inflammation and hemodynamic instability.
2. Presentation: Early symptoms include fever, diaphoresis, or mild evidence of hemodynamic instability (tachycardia) that can progress quickly to cardiovascular collapse and multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Diagnosis: Based on clinical features. Consider obtaining CRP and fer- ritin, although nondiagnostic.
4. Management
a. Tocilizumab: recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-6 receptor.
b. Treat hypotension with IV fluids. If refractory, may require vasopres- sors, intensive care unit (ICU)-level care.
c. Closely monitor neurologic status because these agents are associ- ated with neurotoxicity. Patient should be on seizure prophylaxis.

Note: Transfuse only irradiated and leukoreduced packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and single-donor platelets; cytomegalovirus (CMV)-negative or leukofiltered pRBCs/platelets for CMV-negative patients. Use leukofiltered pRBCs/platelets for those who may undergo transplant in the future to prevent alloimmunization or for those who have had nonhemolytic febrile transfusion reactions. Many oncology patients have nonhemolytic reactions (fever, rash, hypotension, respiratory distress) to pRBCs and/or platelet transfusion and should subsequently be premedicated with diphenhydr- amine and/or acetaminophen.
A. Cytopenias: Anemia, Thrombocytopenia, Neutropenia
1. Etiology: Chemotherapy, medication, radiation, marrow infiltration, blood loss, hemolysis, consumptive coagulopathy.
2. Management
a. See Chapter 14 for details on transfusion.


b. Anemia: Hemoglobin thresholds for pRBC transfusions in cancer patients are based on clinical status and symptoms (often =8 g/dL).
c. Thrombocytopenia: In general, maintain platelet count above
10,000/µL. Patients with active bleeding, fever, or before selected pro- cedures (e.g., lumbar puncture, intramuscular injection) may require higher thresholds. Consider maintaining at higher levels for patients who have brain tumors, recent brain surgery, or history of stroke.
d. Neutropenia:
(1) Broad-spectrum antibiotics with concomitant fever (see Fig. 22.1).
(2) GCSF to assist in recovery of neutrophils.
B. Mucositis
1. Etiology: Damage to endothelial cells of the GI tract from chemotherapy, leading to breakdown of the mucosa. Typically peaks in the first 1 to 2 weeks after chemotherapy.
2. Presentation: Oropharyngeal pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, intolerance of PO intake.
3. Prevention and Management: Supportive care aimed at pain control and nutrition. Local pain control with lidocaine-containing mouthwashes and bicarbonate rinses. Systemic pain control often requires patient- controlled analgesia (PCA) infusion. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is commonly required.
C. Nausea and Emesis
1. Etiology: Chemotherapy side effect. Also suspect opiate therapy, GI and CNS radiotherapy, obstructive abdominal process, elevated ICP, certain antibiotics, or hypercalcemia.
2. Presentation: Can be acute (within 24 hours of chemotherapy initiation), delayed (beyond 24 hours), or anticipatory in subsequent cycles.
3. Therapy: Hydration plus one or more antiemetic medications (Table 22.5; see Formulary for dosing).
Note: Treatment length and dosage may vary per protocol.

 IX. HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION (HSCT)1,2,20	
A. Goal
Administer healthy functioning hematopoietic stem cells from the bone mar- row, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood to a patient whose bone mar- row is diseased (e.g., hematologic malignancy) or depleted (after treatment with intense myeloablative chemotherapy). HSCT is also used for some con- genital and acquired hematologic, immunologic, and metabolic disorders.
B. Preparative Regimens
1. Myeloablative: Elimination of recipient's diseased marrow with high-dose chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus total body irradiation (TBI) prior

to stem cell infusion. Generally, provides greater anticancer activity but carries a higher risk of treatment-related organ injury.
2. Nonmyeloablative: Reduced-intensity conditioning regimen where mar- row is not fully ablated, allowing recovery of autologous hematopoiesis if patient fails to engraft. Associated with decreased treatment-related mortality but higher risk of relapse or transplant rejection.
C. Types of HSCT
1. Allogeneic
a. Recipient is transfused with donor stem cells from genetically similar but nonidentical donor, following a preparative regimen that includes chemotherapy and often radiation. Donors are screened for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) subtype matching to recipient. Possible donors include HLA-matched siblings, fully or partially HLA-matched unrelated donors, umbilical cord blood units, and HLA-haploidentical (half-matched) related donors.
b. Increased level of mismatch between donor and recipient increases the risk for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) but may offer greater graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) immunologic treatment effect.
c. Used commonly for leukemias, myelodysplastic syndrome, hemo- phagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and a number of nonmalignant hematologic, immunologic, and metabolic disorders.
2. Autologous
a. Donor is recipient. After several cycles of conventional chemother- apy, stem cells from patient are harvested from the patient, stored, and given back after the patient has received intense myeloablative doses of chemotherapy.
b. Generally, lacks GVHD or GVL effect.
c. Used for high-risk neuroblastoma, lymphoma, and various high-risk solid tumors, which have demonstrated improved disease control after higher intensity chemotherapy that would otherwise be limited by excessive marrow suppression.
D. Engraftment
1. Recipient's bone marrow is repopulated with donor stem cells that proliferate and mature.
2. Usually starts within 2 to 4 weeks of transplant and may present with an inflammatory response, but can be significantly delayed with certain conditions, drug toxicity, or infection.
3. Defined as an ANC more than 500/µl for 3 consecutive days.

 X. COMPLICATIONS OF HSCT1,2,20-22	
A. Graft-Versus-Host Disease
1. Etiology: Donor T-cell-mediated reaction to unique host antigens. Risk factors include HLA disparity, source of stem cells (peripheral blood > bone marrow > umbilical cord blood), magnitude of conditioning-related tissue injury, and posttransplant infections.


2. Presentation: Acute GVHD most commonly occurs within 6 weeks of transplantation, typically within 100 days of transplantation; rarely, it may occur or persist beyond this time. Chronic GVHD traditionally pres- ents >100 days after transplant but may occur earlier and persist.
a. Maculopapular skin rash. Can progress to bullous lesions resembling toxic epidermal necrolysis.
b. GI symptoms: Anorexia, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, secretory diarrhea.
c. Laboratory findings: Direct hyperbilirubinemia.
d. Chronic GVHD can involve nearly any organ. Commonly includes sclerodermatous skin changes, cholestasis/hepatitis, lung involve- ment (restrictive or obstructive), and/or dry eyes and mouth.
3. Diagnosis: Triad of rash, abdominal cramping with diarrhea, hyper- bilirubinemia. Tissue biopsy of skin or mucosa can provide histologic confirmation, demonstrating lymphocytic infiltration and apoptosis. See Section XIII for clinical staging.
4. Prevention and Management
a. Prophylaxis: Immunosuppression with posttransplant cyclophos- phamide, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and/or sirolimus; adjuvants include methotrexate and prednisone.
b. First-line treatment: Grade 1 and 2 GVHD may be treated locally with topical steroids (skin) or nonabsorbable enteral steroids (gut). First- line systemic treatment is corticosteroids, often with an additional immunosuppressant.
c. Note: Patients with cGVHD are functionally asplenic and significantly immunosuppressed, requiring antimicrobial prophylaxis.
B. Sinusoidal Obstructive Syndrome (SOS); Veno-Occlusive Disease (VOD)
1. Etiology: Injury to endothelial cells leads to activation of the clotting cascade in liver sinusoids, causing erythrocyte congestion and occlu- sive fibrosis of terminal intrahepatic venules and sinusoids. Occurs as a consequence of hematopoietic cell transplantation, hepatotoxic
chemotherapy, and/or high-dose liver radiation. Typically occurs within 3 weeks of the insult, most common at the end of the first week after transplant.
2. Presentation: Tender hepatomegaly, hyperbilirubinemia, edema, ascites, unexplained weight gain, thrombocytopenia refractory to transfusions.
3. Diagnosis: There are two established clinical diagnostic criteria, the Modified Seattle and Baltimore. Updated criteria based on growing understanding of the pathophysiology have recently been proposed.26,30 As each has limitations, consideration of all factors enables earlier diag- nosis, treatment, and improved outcomes.
a. Modified Seattle Criteria: Two of the following events within 20 days of HSCT: Bilirubin >2 mg/dL; tender hepatomegaly; weight gain >2%.
b. Baltimore Criteria: Bilirubin >2 mg/dL within 21 days of HSCT plus two of the following: Hepatomegaly; ascites; weight gain >5%.


c. Proposed updated criteria, unpublished as of this writing, have an expanded time frame with no time restriction to symptom develop- ment and broaden the definition by including transfusion refractory thrombocytopenia and imaging/biopsy results as eligible criteria.
d. Severe SOS is defined by the above, plus pulmonary and/or renal organ failure.
e. Imaging: Doppler US showing reversal of flow in the portal venous system is often found with severe SOS (although its absence does not rule out SOS).
4. Prevention and Treatment
a. Prevention: Ursodeoxycholic acid from conditioning through 90 days post transplant.
b. Treatment: Mild/moderate SOS can be managed with supportive care, including fluid and sodium restriction and diuretics. Defibrotide is the only approved pharmacologic treatment modality, with improved outcomes with earlier initiation and a 50% response rate. Maintain coagulation factors, platelets, and RBCs in stable range secondary to consumption.
c. See Section XIII, for discussion of additional complications, including engraftment syndrome, thrombotic microangiopathy, hemorrhagic cystitis, and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome.

A. Complications of HSCT1,2,19-21,25-29
1. Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD)
   See Table EC 22.A for grading of acute GVHD. Acute GVHD should be graded weekly through day +100. If systemic treatment is started, it should be graded twice weekly while on treatment.
2. Engraftment Syndrome
a. Etiology: Occurs several days prior to donor cell engraftment and in days following white blood cell recovery owing to endothelial injury and activated granulocytes in the setting of proinflammatory cyto- kines. Occurs in approximately 20% of HSCT patients.
b. Presentation: Fever and rash; can have pulmonary infiltrates, diar- rhea, or signs of shock.
c. Diagnosis: Similar presentation to GVHD and infection. Imperative to rule out infection while treating empirically with antibiotics. Often mild and self-limited. However, if symptoms continue for = 48 hours
or are severe, consider initiation of corticosteroids. If insufficient ste-
roid response after 72 hours, can biopsy for alternative diagnoses.
d. Treatment: Treatment with supportive care and corticosteroids; opti- mization of GVHD prophylaxis. If biopsy confirms immune-mediated pathology, can treat with additional immunosuppressive agents.
3. Transplant-Associated Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TA-TMA)
a. Etiology: Associated with immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus) and infection.
b. Presentation: Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and consumptive thrombocytopenia. Often associated with renal insufficiency/failure; may be associated with neurologic symptoms.
c. Diagnosis: Anemia and thrombocytopenia on CBC, schistocytes on periph- eral blood smear, hematuria, proteinuria, casts on urinalysis, elevated LDH, decreased haptoglobin, impaired renal function, elevated d-dimer on coagulation panel.
d. Treatment: Supportive care with blood products, fluid management, and dialysis. Address underlying etiology-consider alternative immunosup- pressant and treat any underlying infection. For progressive or severe TA-TMA, consider neutralization of compliment with eculizumab.31
4. Hemorrhagic Cystitis
a. Etiology: Pretransplant conditioning regimens (specifically those that include cyclophosphamide, pelvic or total body irradiation [TBI]) or viral reactivation (adenovirus, BK virus).
b. Presentation: Hematuria, dysuria, difficulty voiding due to clots.
c. Diagnosis: Urine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for adeno- virus and BK virus, bacterial cultures, bladder ultrasound, CBC, coagulation studies.
d. Treatment: Hydration, analgesics, platelet transfusion, treatment of any underlying infections. For obstruction, Foley catheter with blad- der irrigation.


5. Idiopathic Pneumonia Syndrome
a. Etiology: Widespread alveolar injury in the absence of infection or other known etiology. Thought to occur from a variety of insults, including toxic effects of the conditioning regimen, immunologic cell-mediated injury, and inflammation secondary to cytokine release following engraftment. Most commonly occurs within the first 120 days after transplant.
b. Presentation: Rapidly progressive dry cough, dyspnea, hypoxemia, diffuse radiographic opacities; may progress to ARDS.
c. Diagnosis: Imaging; bronchoalveolar lavage with transbronchial biopsy, if tolerated.
d. Prevention and Management: Supportive care together with broad- spectrum antibiotics while infectious studies pending. IV corticoste- roids and tumor necrosis factor-a inhibitor etanercept if no infection identified.32

Palliative Care
Joshua Natbony, MD

 I. INTRODUCTION TO HOSPICE AND PALLIATIVE MEDICINE	
A. Definition of Palliative Care1,2
1. Palliative care is the active total care of the child's body, mind, and spirit with the intent to prevent and relieve suffering, with a special focus on symptom control.
2. Palliative medicine supports the best quality of life for the child and family. It can be provided along with disease-directed treatment from the time of diagnosis of serious illness.
3. See Fig. 23.1 for the current accepted model of palliative care.
B. Definition of Hospice
1. Hospice care is an insurance benefit that may be initiated for patients who have a terminal illness with a life expectancy estimated to be 6 months or less.
2. It specializes in care at the end of life to promote a child's comfort and to support loved ones in their bereavement.
C. Team Composition
1. Hospice and palliative care teams are often robust and interdisciplinary.
2. They generally include physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, physi- cian assistants, social workers, child life specialists, pastoral care, patient care coordinators, and bereavement coordinators.

 II. COMMUNICATION AND DECISION MAKING	
A. Decision-Making Tools3
1. Provide framework for discussion with families regarding medical issues, quality of life, family goals, preferences, and other contextual preferences, such as spirituality and culture.
2. Advance directives:
a. Adolescents aged 18 years and older, if they are unable to speak for themselves, can name another adult to make healthcare decisions.
b. Children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age can actively participate in decision making by using helpful tools such as "Five Wishes" and "Voicing My Choices" (see in Section IV).
B. Structuring Family Meetings4
1. Make sure that all necessary individuals are present and understand the purpose of the meeting.
2. Make sure that all clinicians are in agreement about the patient's condition and the recommendations.
3. Identify the individual who will facilitate the meeting.
4. Choose a private location with minimal distraction.
5. Always have water and tissues available.
6. Begin by introducing all participants and the purpose of the meeting.
7. Assess what the family knows and expects with respect to the patient's condition.
8. Describe the clinical situation, providing the big picture and then ask- ing family members if they would like or are ready for more details.
9. Encourage each member of the family to express concerns and questions.
10. Explore the patient's and family's values and how they influence deci- sion making.
11. Propose goals for the patient's care that reflect the stated values.
12. Provide a concrete follow-up plan.
C. Breaking Bad News5
1. Prepare yourself: Know the medical information, know what you will say, ask the patient/family if they want someone in particular present with them for the discussion.
2. Prepare the family/patient: Give a brief, calm statement that leads into the news.
3. State the news: Do this clearly and concisely, and be as definitive as possible.
4. Wait for the patient/family's reaction: Resist the urge to say more; allow others to speak first.
5. Reflect the response back: "This news is clearly very upsetting to you."
6. Legitimize the reaction: "It is understandable that you would be upset."
7. Explore: "What upsets you the most about this news?"
8. Provide realistic hope.


9. Discuss next steps (if appropriate at this time): "May I address your concerns now and talk about the next steps for treatment, or would you like more time?"
D. Other Tools for Difficult Conversations
1. Assess spirituality according to the "FICA" tool6:
a. Faith and belief: "Do you consider yourself spiritual or religious?"
b. Importance in life: "What importance does your faith or belief system have in your life?"
c. Community: "Are you a part of a spiritual or religious community?"
d. Address in care: "How would you like me, your healthcare provider, to address these issues in your healthcare?"
2. "Ask-tell-ask"7
a. Ask the patient or family to describe their understanding of the situa- tion or issue.
b. Tell them what you need to communicate in a straightforward manner.
c. Ask them questions to assess their understanding.
3. "Hope together" with the patient and family while also preparing for all possible outcomes.

 III. CARE OF THE DYING CHILD	
A. Limiting Interventions
The following options should be considered.
1. Do not attempt resuscitation (DNAR)-foregoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and other resuscitative interventions as part of an overall care plan that emphasizes comfort and quality of living.
2. Do not intubate (DNI)-although, if clinically appropriate, intubation may still allow the initiation of continuous positive-pressure ventilation or may help in managing symptoms.
3. Do not escalate treatment-the choice to forego changes in treatment, even as a patient's condition worsens, because death is expected. Examples of such requests include the following:
a. Do not increase the dose of current medications (e.g., vasopressors).
b. Do not add new medications (e.g., antibiotics).
c. Do not initiate new interventions (e.g., dialysis, mechanical ventilation).
d. However, one may still initiate and increase interventions to treat pain and reduce suffering.
4. Discontinuing current interventions-the option of discontinuing inter- ventions that prolong the dying process must also be discussed.
5. Medical orders for life-sustaining treatment and physician orders for life-sustaining treatment (POLST) forms:
a. These are portable and enduring medical order forms completed by patients or their authorized decision makers and are signed by a physician.


b. They contain orders regarding CPR and other life-sustaining treatments.
c. If a state offers one of these forms, the orders are valid for emer- gency medical service providers as well as healthcare providers and facilities within that state.
d. A copy must be provided to the patient or authorized decision maker within 48 hours of completion or sooner if the patient is to be transferred.
e. Refer to your state's laws prior to completing any documentation.
f. Additional information for US providers can be found at www.polst. org.
B. Involving the Child in Conversations About Death8-11
1. See Table 23.1 for the development of death concepts in children.12
2. A minor child has the capacity to meaningfully participate in medical decision making if he or she demonstrates the ability to do all of the following:
a. Communicate understanding of the medical information.
b. State his or her preference.
c. Communicate understanding of the consequences of decisions.
3. Helpful documents are available for purchase from the nonprofit Aging with Dignity (see Section IV.B).
a. Five Wishes: This is a legal advance directive with versions tailored for adolescents.
b. Voicing My Choices: A workbook for adolescents intended to comple- ment Five Wishes.
c. My Wishes: A simple booklet for younger children to help them share their preferences.

c. A rapid autopsy involves the urgent removal of tissues for research uses.
2. Frequently asked questions
a. A voluntary autopsy can look at all parts of a patient's body or only some.
b. An autopsy will not affect the patient's body cosmetically and should not affect funeral or viewing arrangements.
c. An autopsy takes 2 to 4 hours to perform and should not delay funeral/burial arrangements.
3. Benefits of autopsy
a. For families:
(1) Provides closure regarding diagnosis.
(2) Identifies possible genetic etiologies for unexplained death.
b. For providers: clarifies potential diagnostic errors and uncertainties.

 I. OVERVIEW	
A. Epidemiology and General Approach
1. Prevalence: 15% to 20% of children in primary care practices require psychiatric care.1
2. Surveillance and Screening:
a. Surveillance for mental health issues should occur at all routine well- child visits from early childhood through adolescence.
b. The Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC) is a general mental health checklist that screens for a broad array of disorders (Table 24.1).
3. See the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edi- tion (DSM-5), for full list of psychiatric diagnoses.2
4. Pharmacotherapy for many disorders may be managed or monitored by the pediatrician. See Riddle et al., "Pediatric Psychopharmacology for Primary Care."3
B. Mental Status Exam
1. General appearance: dress, self-care, demeanor, attitude, behavior
2. Motor activity: activity level (restless, fidgety, stereotyped or ritualized movements)
3. Speech and language: fluency, comprehension, rate, rhythm, volume, expressive and receptive skills
4. Mood and affect: stated and observed
5. Thought form/content
a. What patient is thinking about
b. Goal-directed nature of thoughts, coherence, organization, delusional content
6. Abnormal perceptual phenomena: illusions, hallucinations
7. Insight, judgment, cognition

 II. POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION	
A. Epidemiology4:
Prevalence in most studies is between 10% and 15%
B. Screening:
1. Universal screening is recommended for all postpartum women.
2. A history of depression doubles the risk of postpartum depression and should prompt careful assessment for postpartum symptoms.5

C. Diagnosis:
1. Depression occurring in the 12-month period after birth.
2. Maternal depression is important to identify and treat, given the sub- stantial impact on the health of the developing infant. Impaired maternal attachment may compromise the social, cognitive, and behavioral devel- opment of the infant.4
3. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale is a 10-item questionnaire which can be completed in 5 minutes or less.6
D. Treatment:
1. Referral to mother's primary care physician or mental health expert is preferred.
2. Integrating maternal mental health into pediatrics practice is ideal.6

A. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
1. Epidemiology:
a. Persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development.
b. Prevalence continues to rise. This disorder affected 11.0% (6.4 mil- lion) of children in the United States in 2011, marking an increase from 9.5% (5.4 million) of children in 2007.7,8
c. Most affected children continue to meet the diagnostic crite- ria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) through adolescence.
2. Screening: Evaluate all children aged 4 to 18 years who have aca- demic and/or behavioral concerns for ADHD and common comorbid conditions (depression, anxiety, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder).9
3. Diagnosis2:
a. DSM-5 diagnostic criteria: inattention, impulsivity/hyperactivity that are more frequent and severe than typically observed in children of the same developmental age.
b. Symptoms must persist for 6 months or more, occur before the age of 12 years, and should be evident in two or more settings (e.g., home and school). 2,10
c. Subtypes: Combined, predominantly inattentive, or predominantly hyperactive/impulsive.
d. Diagnosis is made using history, observation, and behavioral check- lists such as the Vanderbilt Assessment Scale (see Table 24.1).
e. If the medical history is unremarkable, no further laboratory or neurologic testing is required. Psychological and neuropsychologi- cal testing is not required for diagnosis but is recommended if other academic or developmental concerns are present.10


4. Treatment:
a. Pharmacologic treatment works best with behavioral therapy as an adjunct.9
b. Behavioral therapy may be tried alone in preschool-age children (4 to 5 years old), but for older children or in preschool-age children where behavioral therapy is ineffective, combination therapy with pharmacologic and behavioral interventions is most effective.11
c. Before starting a stimulant medication, a history should be taken to exclude cardiac symptoms, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, a family history of sudden death, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and
long-QT syndrome. Screening electrocardiography is not required if there is no personal or family history of cardiac disease.12
d. See Table 24.2 for recommended pharmacologic treatments. The ADHD Medication Guide provides visual information (see Section VI).
(1) For preschool-age children (4 to 5 years old), start with behav- ioral therapy and, if necessary, a methylphenidate stimulant.3,11
(2) For elementary-age children (6 or more years old), start with behav- ioral and stimulant therapy (methylphenidate or amphetamine).3,11
e. Titrate medications to maximal symptom control with minimal side effects.
f. Common side effects of stimulants to monitor include appetite suppression, abdominal pain, headaches, palpitations, and sleep disturbance.9
g. If the first stimulant is ineffective, consider an alternative class of stimulant. Second-line options as alternative therapy or as an aug- menting agent to stimulant therapy include guanfacine, clonidine, and atomoxetine.3,11
h. If multiple medication trials prove ineffective, consultation with a pediatric psychiatrist is suggested.
B. Anxiety Disorders
1. Epidemiology:
a. A group of disorders characterized by excessive fear, anxiety, and related behavioral disturbances.
b. An estimated 4.7% of all children 3 to 17 years of age are affected, with onset most often before the age of 25 and increased prevalence (15% to 20%) among adolescents 13 to 17 years of age.13-15
2. Clinical Presentation:
a. May present with fear or worry and without recognizing that their fear or anxiety is unreasonable.
b. Commonly have somatic complaints of headache and abdominal pain. Patients with many primary care visits for such complaints may benefit from formal anxiety screening.
c. Fear/anxiety may affect school performance or manifest as school avoidance.
d. Crying, irritability, angry outbursts, and disruptive behavior are expressions of fear and an effort to avoid anxiety-provoking stimuli.

3. Screening: Multiple tools, such as the Self-Report for Childhood Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) (Table 24.1), are available.
4. Diagnosis:
a. DSM-5 diagnostic criteria vary based on the specific disorder2: (1) generalized anxiety disorder, (2) separation anxiety disorder, (3) social anxiety disorder, (4) selective mutism, (5) specific phobia, (6) panic disorder, (7) agoraphobia
b. Differential diagnosis: obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder.
5. Treatment: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with or without pharma- cotherapy (see Table 24.2) based on the disorder and its severity.16


C. Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)17
1. Epidemiology:
a. Pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness.
b. Prevalence estimated at approximately 3%. Increased prevalence in boys as compared with girls in the preteen years but not in the teens.
c. Age of onset approximately 6 years of age, frequently comorbid with ADHD.
2. Screening: Many screening tools are available, including the Vanderbilt Assessment Scale (see Table 24.1).18
3. Diagnosis2:
a. DSM-5 diagnostic criteria: angry/irritable mood with argumentative/ defiant behavior and vindictiveness for 6 or more months.
b. Behavior must be present with at least one nonsibling.
4. Treatment:
a. No evidence for pharmacologic intervention as first-line therapy for ODD.
b. Combination of CBT and parent management training may be most effective as first-line intervention.17

 IV. COMMON PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS IN ADOLESCENTS	
A. Depressive Disorders
1. Epidemiology:
a. A group of disorders characterized by mood changes as well as somatic and cognitive symptoms that disrupt functioning.
b. Prevalence of major depressive disorder: 2% of children, 4% to 8% of adolescents.15
c. Subclinical symptoms: 5% to 10% of children.
d. Common comorbid conditions: anxiety disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, ADHD, substance use.
2. Screening:
a. Routine screening is recommended for patients 11 years of age or older.
b. Multiple screening tools are available (see Table 24.1). The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) is a brief but effective tool for use in adolescents.19
c. All patients with suspected depressive symptoms should be screened for suicidal ideation and referred for emergency evaluation if serious thoughts and/or action plans are endorsed (see Section V.A).
3. Diagnosis:
a. DSM-5 Major Depressive Disorder diagnostic criteria:
(1) Five or more of the following symptoms for 2 or more weeks: Must include either depressed mood/irritability OR anhedonia; changes in appetite/weight, sleep, or activity; fatigue or loss of energy; guilt/worthlessness; decreased concentration; suicidality.
(2) Symptoms cause significant impairment in functioning.


(3) Symptoms not due to substance use or a medical condition.
(4) No history of manic episodes.20
b. Other depressive disorders are defined by their own diagnostic crite- ria2: (1) disruptive mood dysregulation disorder; (2) persistent depres- sive disorder (dysthymia); (3) premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
c. Differential diagnosis: bipolar disorder, adjustment disorder.
4. Treatment:
a. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be initiated in the primary care setting. Referral to subspecialist may be required depending on severity or in the case of treatment failure (Fig. 24.1).
b. Antidepressant medications (see Table 24.2) and CBT combined are the most effective treatments, followed by medication alone and then CBT alone.21

SSRI initiation algorithm. CES-DC, Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children; FDA, US Food and Drug Administration; PHQ-9, Patient Health Questionnaire-9; SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.


c. SSRIs have a black box warning from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concerning a possible increase in suicidal thoughts or behaviors after initiation of medication.
(1) The basis of this warning was a large meta-analysis that found no increase in completed suicides but a small increase in suicidal ideation.22
(2) Multiple professional mental health groups support the continued use of SSRIs in treating depression in children and adolescents because the benefits appear to outweigh potential risks.20,23,24
d. Refer to the Physicians Med Guide prepared by the American Psychological Association (APA) and American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) for guidelines regarding medica- tion use for depression in adolescents (see Section VI).25
B. Substance Use Disorders
1. Epidemiology:
a. Lifetime diagnosis of alcohol abuse: 0.4% to 9%; alcohol depen- dence: 0.6% to 4.3%.26
b. Lifetime diagnosis of drug abuse or dependence: 3.3% to 9.8%.26
c. Common comorbid conditions: disruptive behavior disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders.
2. Clinical Presentation:
a. Acute change in mood, behavior, and cognition.
(1) Mood: low to elevated mood
(2) Behavior: disinhibition, lethargy, hyperactivity, agitation, somno- lence, hypervigilance
(3) Cognition: impaired concentration, changes in attention span, perceptual and overt disturbances in thinking (e.g., delusions)
b. Impairment in psychosocial and academic functioning (family con- flict/dysfunction, interpersonal conflict, academic failure).
c. Deviant or risk-taking behavior.26
3. Diagnosis:
a. Establish standards of confidentiality.
b. Administer CRAFFT Questionnaire (see Chapter 5).
c. Evaluate age of onset of use; progression of use for specific substances; circumstances, frequency, and variability of use; types of agents used.
d. Consider urine/serum toxicology evaluation if there is concern for substance use and patient consents to testing.
4. Treatment:
a. Determine goals and readiness for change; promote behavioral change through motivational interviewing.27
b. Families should be involved in treatment.
c. Medications can be used to manage withdrawal symptoms and/or cravings.
d. Treatment of comorbid conditions should occur at the same time.26


C. Eating Disorders
1. Epidemiology:
a. Includes anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa as well as pica, rumination disorder (repeated regurgitation), avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, and binge eating disorder.
b. Twelve-month prevalence of 0.4% (anorexia nervosa) and 1% to 1.5% (bulimia nervosa); 10:1 female-to-male ratio.5
c. Common comorbidities: affective and anxiety disorders.
2. Diagnosis:
a. Anorexia nervosa
(1) Restricted energy intake and low weight (body mass index [BMI]
< 18.5 kg/m2; severity stratified by BMI)
(2) Fear of gaining weight
(3) Disturbance in perception of body weight or shape
b. Bulimia nervosa
(1) Recurrent episodes of binge eating that occur at least once a week for 3 months
(2) Recurrent inappropriate compensatory mechanisms to prevent weight gain (e.g., diuretic or laxative use, exercise) or purging (self-induced vomiting)
(3) Self-evaluation excessively influenced by body shape or weight5
3. Treatment:
a. Aimed at nutritional rehabilitation and therapy (family-based or as a component of day treatment programs). Hospitalization may be needed in cases of medical instability. See Chapter 21 for manage- ment of refeeding syndrome.
b. SSRIs indicated in the treatment of bulimia nervosa (see Table 24.2). No medications have been approved for use in anorexia nervosa.28

 V. PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCIES	
A. Suicide
1. Epidemiology29: Suicide is the second leading cause of death in children and adolescents.
2. Screening:
a. Primary care setting: risk factor screening30 (Fig. 24.2).
b. Emergency department setting: the Ask Suicide-Screening Questions (ASQ) (Box 24.1) is validated for identifying pediatric patients at risk for suicide.
3. Formal suicide assessment (see Fig. 24.2)
a. Any positive reply to a screening question warrants formal evaluation by a psychiatrist or other mental health professional.
b. Goal is to determine disposition (inpatient versus outpatient) and develop a safety plan with caregivers.

B. Agitation31,32
1. Definition:
a. Agitation can be defined as disruptive behavior occurring during periods of emotional distress.
b. Manifestations include
(1) Excessive motor activity: pacing, fidgeting
(2) Verbal aggression: yelling, shouting, rapid uninterruptable speech, threats
(3) Physical aggression: hitting, throwing things
c. Agitation frequently occurs as a manifestation of psychiatric illness, but it can also present in behaviorally disordered youth or as a result of organic neurologic disease.
d. Agitation is a multifactorial symptom. Risk factors for agitation include history of aggression, history of physical abuse, past psy- chiatric hospitalizations, traumatic brain injury, autism spectrum disorder, delirium, and substance use.
2. Management (Fig. 24.3): Determine the etiology of agitation:
a. Review vital signs, presenting history, past diagnoses, past episodes of agitation.
b. Attempt to rule out underlying medical cause (e.g., ingestion, trau- matic brain injury).
3. Treatment
a. Nonpharmacologic
(1) Low-stimulation environment (e.g., dim lights, move child away from busy areas, avoid unnecessary interventions).
(2) Communicate in a calm, neutral, empathetic tone at eye level using simple language.
(3) Utilize distraction techniques and Child Life services if available.
b. Pharmacologic: therapy choice should target the etiology of agitation (see Fig. 24.3).
c. Restraints and seclusion: reserved for cases where both nonphar- macologic and pharmacologic interventions fail. Regulations and requirements for use vary by state.
(1) Close monitoring required.
(2) Frequent reassessment of necessity of restraints.

 I. EVALUATION OF PULMONARY GAS EXCHANGE	
A. Pulse Oximetry1-3
1. Noninvasive and indirect measurement of arterial O2 saturation (SaO2) estimated by light absorption characteristics of oxygenated and deoxy- genated hemoglobin in peripheral blood.
2. Limitations:
a. Measures oxygen saturation, not O2 delivery to tissues.
b. Insensitive to hyperoxia. See Fig. EC 25.A for oxyhemoglobin dis- sociation curve.
c. Artificially increased by carboxyhemoglobin levels >1% to 2%.
d. Artificially decreased by intravenous dyes, opaque nail polish, and methemoglobin levels >1%.
e. Unreliable when pulse signal is poor due to hypothermia, hypovole- mia, shock, edema, and movement artifact.
B. Capnography4,5
1. Measures CO2 concentration of expired gas by infrared or mass spectroscopy.
2. End-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) correlates with PaCO2 (usually within 5 mmHg in healthy subjects).
3. Used to evaluate proper placement of an endotracheal tube, to monitor ventilation in mechanically ventilated patients, to assess effectiveness of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and during polysomnography.
C. Blood Gases6-8
1. Arterial blood gas (ABG): Most accurate way to assess oxygenation (PaO2), ventilation (PaCO2), and acid-base status (pH and HCO3-). See Chapter 28 for normal mean values.
2. Venous blood gas (VBG): PvCO2 averages 6 to 8 mmHg higher than PaCO2; venous pH is slightly lower than arterial pH.
3. Capillary blood gas (CBG): Correlation with ABG is generally best for pH, moderate for PCO2, and worst for PO2.
D. Analysis of Acid-Base Disturbances9-11
The first step is to determine the primary disturbance (metabolic versus respiratory); the second step is to assess for a mixed disorder by calculat- ing expected compensatory response. See Chapter 11 for details.

Provide objective and reproducible measurements of airway function and lung volumes. Used to characterize disease, assess severity, and follow response to therapy.
A. Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR)12,13
Maximal flow rate generated during a forced expiratory maneuver.
1. Used to follow the course of asthma and response to therapy by com- paring current PEFR with the previous "personal best" and the normal predicted value.
2. Limitations: Normal values vary across racial groups, measurement is effort dependent, cannot be used reliably in many young children.
3. Normal predicted PEFR values for children are shown in Table 25.1.
B. Maximal Inspiratory and Expiratory Pressures14,15
Maximal pressure generated during inhalation and exhalation against a fixed obstruction. Used as a measure of respiratory muscle strength.
1. Maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) is in the range of 80 to 120 cm H2O at all ages. A low MIP may be an indication for ventilatory support.
2. Maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) increases with age and is greater in males. A low MEP correlates with decreased effectiveness of coughing.
C. Spirometry (for Children 6 Years of Age or Above)16,17
Plot of airflow versus time during rapid, forceful, complete expiration from total lung capacity (TLC) to residual volume (RV) is useful to character- ize different patterns of airway obstruction (Fig. 25.1). Usually performed before and after bronchodilation to assess response to therapy or after bronchial challenge to assess airway hyperreactivity.

A. Definition
A chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways resulting in reversible airway obstruction. It manifests as recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathless- ness, chest tightness, and cough, particularly at night and in the early


morning. The inflammation causes increased airway hyperreactivity to a variety of stimuli: viral infections, cold air, exercise, emotions, environmen- tal allergens, and pollutants.
B. Clinical Presentation
1. Cough, increased work of breathing (tachypnea, retractions, accessory muscle use), wheezing, hypoxia, and hypoventilation. Crackles may also be present with asthma exacerbations.
2. No audible wheezing may indicate very poor air movement and severe bronchospasm.
3. Radiographic findings: peribronchial thickening, hyperinflation, patchy atelectasis.
C. Treatment
1. See Chapter 1 for acute management of status asthmaticus.
2. Initial classification and initiation of treatment for ages 0 to 4, 5 to 11, and 12 years and above (Figs. 25.3-25.5).
3. Stepwise approach to continued management for ages 0 to 4, 5 to 11, and 12 years and above (Figs. 25.6-25.8)
4. Additional management guidelines available from the Global Initiative for Asthma.21
D. Prevention of Exacerbations
1. Ensure up-to-date immunizations, including influenza.
2. Create an asthma action plan.
3. Identify and minimize asthma triggers and environmental exposures.
4. Assess symptom control, inhaler technique, and medication adherence with regular clinical evaluations.
5. Consider specialist referral for formal PFTs, monitoring, and allergy testing.
6. See Table EC 25.A for dosing guidelines for inhaled corticosteroids.

 IV. BRONCHIOLITIS19-23	
A. Definition
1. Lower respiratory tract infection common in infants and children aged 2 years and younger.
2. Characterized by acute inflammation, edema, and necrosis of airway epithelium, leading to increased mucus production and bronchospasm.
3. Most commonly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but can also be seen with other viruses including parainfluenza virus, adenovi- rus, mycoplasma, and human metapneumovirus.

B. Clinical Presentation
1. Rhinitis and cough, which may progress to tachypnea, wheezing, rales, use of accessory muscles, and/or nasal flaring. Transient apnea may also be seen.
2. Radiographic findings: hyperinflation and atelectasis.
3. Radiographs and viral testing should NOT be routinely obtained.

Notes
 The stepwise approach is meant to assist, not replace, the clinical decision making required to
meet individual patient needs.
 Level of severity is determined by both impairment and risk. Assess impairment domain by patient's/caregiver's recall of previous 2-4 weeks. Symptomassessment for longer periods should reflect a global assessment such as inquiring whether the patient's asthma is better or worse since the last visit. Assign severity to the most severe category in which any feature occurs.
 At present, there are inadequate data to correspond frequencies of exacerbations with different levels of asthma severity. For treatment purposes, patients who had ?2 exacerbations requiring oral systemic corticosteroids in the past 6 months, or ?4 wheezing episodes in the past year, and who have risk factors for persistent asthma may be considered the same as patients who have persistent asthma, even in the absence of impairment levels consistent
with persistent asthma.

 At present, there are inadequate data to correspond frequencies of exacerbations with different levels of asthma severity. In general, more frequent and intense exacerbations (e.g., requiring urgent, unscheduled care, hospitalization, or ICU admission) indicate greater underlying disease severity. For treatment purposes, patients who had ?2 exacerbations requiring oral systemic corticosteroids in the past year may be considered the same as patients who have persistent asthma, even in the absence of impairment levels consistent with persistent asthma.

Notes
 The stepwise approach is meant to assist, not replace, the clinical decision making
required to meet individual patient needs.
 Level of severity is determined by both impairment and risk. Assess impairment domain by patient's/caregiver's recall of previous 2-4 weeks and spirometry. Assign severity to the most severe category in which any feature occurs.
 At present, there are inadequate data to correspond frequencies of exacerbations with different levels of asthma severity. In general, more frequent and intense exacerbations (e.g., requiring urgent, unscheduled care, hospitalization, or ICU admission) indicate greater underlying disease severity. For treatment purposes, patients who had ?2 exacerbations requiring oral systemic corticosteroids in the past year may be considered the same as patients who have persistent asthma, even in the absence of impairment levels consistent with persistent asthma.

Notes:
 The stepwise approach is meant to assist, not replace, the clinical decision making required to meet individual patient needs.
 If alternative treatment is used and response is inadequate, discontinue it and use the preferred treatment before stepping up.
 Theophylline is a less desirable alternative due to the need to monitor serum concentration levels.

Step 3 ICS + adjunctive therapy and ICS are based on Evidence B for efficacy of each treatment and extrapolation from comparator trials in older children and adults-comparator trials are not available for this age group; steps 4-6 are based on expert opinion and extrapolation from studies in older children and adults.
 Immunotherapy for steps 2-4 is based on Evidence B for house dust mites, animal danders, and pollens; evidence is weak or lacking for molds and cockroaches. Evidence is strongest for immunotherapy with single allergens. The role of allergy in asthma is greater in children than in adults. Clinicians who administer immunotherapy should be prepared and equipped to identify and treat anaphylaxis that may occur.

Quick-relief medication for all patients
 SABA as needed for symptoms. Intensity of treatment depends on severity of symptoms: up to 3 treatments at 20-min intervals as needed. Short course of oral systemic corticosteroids may be needed.
 Use of SABA >2 days a week for symptom relief (not prevention of EIB) generally indicates inadequate control and the need to step up treatment.
Key: Alphabetical order is used when more than one treatment option is listed within either preferred or alternative therapy. EIB, exercise-induced bronchospasm; ICS, inhaled corticosteroid; LABA, long-acting inhaled ?2-agonist; LTRA, leukotriene receptor antagonist; PRN, as needed;
SABA, short-acting inhaled ?2-agonist
Notes:
 The stepwise approach is meant to assist, not replace, the clinical decision making required to meet
individual patient needs.
 If alternative treatment is used and response is inadequate, discontinue it and use the preferred
treatment before stepping up.
 Zileuton is a less-desirable alternative as adjunctive therapy due to limited studies and the need to
monitor liver function. Theophylline requires monitoring of serum concentration levels.
 In step 6, before oral systemic corticosteroids are introduced, a trial of high-dose ICS + LABA + either LTRA, theophylline, or zileuton may be considered, although this approach has not been studied in clinical trials.
 Step 1, 2, and 3 preferred therapies are based on Evidence A; step 3 alternative therapy is based on Evidence A for LTRA, Evidence B for theophylline, and Evidence D for zileuton. Step 4 preferred therapy is based on Evidence B, and alternative therapy is based on Evidence B for LTRA and theophylline and Evidence D for zileuton. Step 5 preferred therapy is based on Evidence B. Step 6 preferred therapy is based on Expert Panel Report 2 (1997) and Evidence B for omalizumab.
 Immunotherapy for steps 2-4 is based on Evidence B for house dust mites, animal danders, and pollens; evidence is weak or lacking for molds and cockroaches. Evidence is strongest for immunotherapy with single allergens. The role of allergy in asthma is greater in children than in adults.
 Clinicians who administer immunotherapy or omalizumab should be prepared and equipped to identify and treat anaphylaxis that may occur.

C. Treatment
Mainstay is supportive care.
1. Assess risk factors for severe disease, such as age less than 12 weeks, a history of prematurity, underlying cardiopulmonary disease, or immunodeficiency.
2. Clinicians should NOT administer albuterol, epinephrine, systemic corticosteroids, or chest physiotherapy to previously healthy infants and children with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis. Antibiotics should be adminis- tered only for concomitant bacterial infection.
3. Nebulized hypertonic saline may be administered to hospitalized infants and children, although evidence of effectiveness is mixed.20-22
4. Evidence supporting continuous pulse oximetry and supplemental O2 when SpO2 is greater than 90% is currently lacking.
5. Nasogastric or intravenous fluid is necessary when infant is unable to maintain oral hydration.
6. High-flow nasal cannula supports breathing in infants requiring supple- mental oxygen and may decrease the rate of escalation of care.23
7. RSV immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab for high-risk infants (see Chapter 16).

 V. BRONCHOPULMONARY DYSPLASIA (BPD)24-27	
A. Definition
1. Also known as chronic lung disease of prematurity or chronic lung disease of infancy.
2. Chronic pulmonary condition that usually evolves after premature birth, characterized by a need for oxygen supplementation >21% for at least 28 days after birth.
3. Thought to be a result of airway inflammation, damage from hyperoxia, hypoxia, or mechanical ventilation; results in interference with normal lung alveolar, airway, and vascular development.
4. Earlier gestational age in preterm infants is associated with a higher likelihood of BPD development.
B. Clinical Presentation
Children with BPD may have persistent respiratory symptoms, airway hyperreactivity, and supplemental oxygen requirements, especially during intercurrent illness.
C. Diagnosis
Severity based on oxygen requirement at time of assessment and charac- terized as mild if on room air, moderate if requiring <30% oxygen or severe if requiring >30% oxygen and/or positive pressure.
1. If gestational age at birth was <32 weeks, assess infant at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age or at discharge to home, whichever comes first.
2. If gestational age at birth >32 weeks, assess infant at 28 to 56 days postnatal age or at discharge to home, whichever comes first.


D. Treatment
1. Children with BPD often require some combination of the following for their lung disease:
a. Bronchodilators
b. Antiinflammatory agents (corticosteroids)
c. Supplemental oxygen therapy
d. Diuretics
e. Tracheostomy and prolonged mechanical ventilation for severe cases
f. RSV prophylaxis if indicated (see Chapter 16)
2. Children with BPD need close monitoring for complications, which can affect additional organ systems and processes, including pulmonary
or systemic hypertension, electrolyte abnormalities, nephrocalcinosis (from chronic diuretics), neurodevelopmental or growth delay, aspiration from dysphagia and/or gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and more severe infections with RSV or influenza.

 VI. CYSTIC FIBROSIS28-37	
A. Definition
Autosomal recessive disorder in which mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene reduce the function of a chloride channel that usually resides on the surface of epithelial cells in the airways, pancreatic ducts, biliary tree, intestine, vas deferens, and sweat glands, resulting in progressive obstructive pulmonary disease and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.
B. Clinical Manifestations (Fig. 25.9)
C. Diagnosis
Diagnosing CF is a multistep process (Fig. 25.10); a complete evaluation involves the following:
1. Newborn screening (NBS): utilizes blood immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) level and/or CFTR gene mutation analysis.
2. Quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis (sweat chloride) test: gold standard for diagnosis. False-positive results can be seen in untreated adrenal insufficiency, glycogen storage disease type 1, fucosidosis, hypothyroidism, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, ectodermal dysplasia, malnutrition, mucopolysaccharidosis, and panhypopituitarism.
3. Genetic analysis: over 2000 CFTR mutations have been described; the most common is F508del.
D. Treatment
Patients with CF should be managed within a CF Foundation accredited care center.
1. Pulmonary
a. Airway clearance therapy to mobilize airway secretions and facilitate expectoration. Often manual/mechanical percussion and postural drainage is used. Older children may use high-frequency vest therapy, mechanical chest percussors, or oscillatory positive expira- tory pressure (PEP) handheld devices.

b. Aerosolized medications to enhance mucociliary clearance: Recombinant human DNAase (dornase alfa) and aerosolized hyper- tonic saline to hydrate airway mucus and stimulate cough.
c. Chronic antibiotics. If Pseudomonas aeruginosa is persistently present in airway cultures, chronic aerosolized antibiotic and/or oral macrolide therapy may be considered.
d. Intermittent use of intravenous antibiotics when patient is hospi- talized for exacerbations. Common bacteria that cause exacerba- tions include P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. There
is no current consensus regarding antibiotic choice, dosing, or duration.


e. CFTR modulator therapy may be effective for patients with specific mutations (G551D, F508del/F508del). Can be used in combination. See Formulary for dosing.
f. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) treatment may include oral corticosteroids; antifungal therapy can be a helpful adjunct therapy.
g. Lung transplantation.
2. Extrapulmonary
a. Pancreatic and liver disease
(1) Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy prior to meals to improve digestion and intestinal absorption of dietary protein and fat.
(2) Fat-soluble vitamin A, D, E, and K supplementation.
(3) Nutritional supplementation to maintain body mass index (BMI) at or above the 50th percentile.
(4) Monitoring for CF-related diabetes or liver disease.
b. Infertility
(1) Men have absence of the vas deferens; however, assisted fertiliza- tion is possible using aspiration of viable sperm from testes.
(2) Women who are healthy have relatively normal fertility.
c. Decreased life expectancy. Survival continues to improve, and median predicted survival age is more than 47 years.37

 VII. OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA SYNDROME (OSAS)38-42	
A. Definition
Disorder of breathing during sleep characterized by prolonged partial upper airway obstruction and/or intermittent complete obstruction that disrupts normal ventilation during sleep and normal sleep patterns.

B. Clinical Presentation
1. Habitual snoring sometimes accompanied by snorts, gasps, or intermit- tent pauses in breathing. Increased respiratory effort during sleep.
2. Disturbed or restless sleep with increased arousals and awakenings.
3. Daytime cognitive and/or behavioral problems. Young children rarely present with daytime sleepiness.
4. Long-term complications: neurocognitive impairment, behavioral problems, poor growth, cardiac dysfunction, systemic and pulmonary hypertension.
5. Risk factors: adenotonsillar hypertrophy, obesity, family history of OSAS, craniofacial or laryngeal anomalies, prematurity, nasal/pharyngeal inflammation, cerebral palsy, and neuromuscular disease.

C. Diagnosis
1. All children and adolescents should be routinely screened for snoring.
2. If a child snores on a regular basis and has any of the complaints or findings shown in Box 25.1, clinicians should obtain a polysomnogram or, if polysomnography is not available, refer the patient to a sleep spe- cialist or otolaryngologist for more extensive evaluation.


BOX 25.1
SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS OF OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA SYNDROME
I. History
Frequent snoring (=3 nights a week) Labored breathing during sleep
Gasping/snorting noises or observed episodes of apnea Sleep enuresis (especially secondary enuresis)
Sleeping in a seated position or with the neck hyperextended Cyanosis
Headache on awakening Daytime sleepiness
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder Learning problems
II. Physical examination
Underweight or overweight Tonsillar hypertrophy Adenoidal facies Micrognathia/retrognathia High-arched palate
Failure to thrive Hypertension

Adapted from Marcus CL, Brooks LJ, Draper KA, et al. Diagnosis and management of childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Pediatrics. 2012;130:575-584.

3. Polysomnogrpaphy criteria for OSAS diagnosis (one of the following):
a. One or more obstructive or mixed apnea or hypopnea events per hour (AHI =1).
b. PaCO2 >50 mmHg for >25% of sleep time coupled with snoring,
paradoxical thoracoabdominal movement, or flattening of nasal airway pressure waveform implying flow limitation.
4. No standard severity classification. Commonly used: mild (1< AHI =5), moderate (5< AHI =10), and severe (AHI >10).
D. Treatment
1. Weight loss for patients who are overweight or obese.
2. Intranasal corticosteroids may be considered for children with mild OSAS.38 Follow-up is needed to assess symptoms and monitor possible adverse effects of long-term intranasal steroids. Oral leukotriene inhibi- tor (e.g., montelukast) can also be considered.
3. Adenotonsillectomy is recommended as first-line treatment of patients with OSAS documented with an overnight polysomnogram.42 Patients should be reevaluated postoperatively to determine whether further treatment is required.
a. Risk factors for postoperative respiratory complications: age <3 years, severe OSAS on polysomnography (AHI =10, lowest oxygen


saturation <80%, and/or significant hypercapnia), cardiac complica- tions of OSAS, failure to thrive, obesity, craniofacial anomalies, neuro- muscular disorders, current respiratory infection.
b. High-risk children warrant a more comprehensive evaluation and postoperative admission for monitoring.
4. Continuous positive airway pressure is recommended as treat- ment if adenotonsillectomy is not performed or if OSAS persists postoperatively.
5. Craniofacial surgery and tracheostomy are reserved for severe cases in children with syndromic craniofacial abnormalities.

 VIII. INFANT AND CHILD SLEEP43-46	
A. Sleep Duration
1. Recommended average sleep duration varies by age (Table 25.3).
2. Sleep concerns are common in childhood. Inadequate or poor- quality sleep can have negative impacts on health, behavior, and learning.
3. See Section XI for a discussion of common childhood sleep disorders.

 TABLE 25.3	 RECOMMENDED AVERAGE SLEEP DURATION

Age Group	Duration of Sleep (per 24 hr)
Toddlers (1-2 years)	11-14 hra

School-age children (6-12 years)	9-12 hr
aRecommended sleep duration in 24-hour period includes naps. Adapted from Paruthi S, Brooks LJ, D'Ambrosio C, et al. Recommended amount of sleep for pediatric populations: a consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. J Clin Sleep Med. 2016;12(6):785-786.


B. Sleep-Related Infant Death
1. Definition
a. Sleep-related infant death: sudden unexplained infant death occur- ring during an observed or unobserved sleep period.
b. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS): cause assigned to infant death that cannot be explained after thorough case investigation.
2. Epidemiology
a. Approximately 40 per 100,000 live births in 2013, more than double in African American and Native American populations.
b. Peak incidence is at 1 to 4 months, with 90% occurring before 6 months.


3. Safe Infant Sleep
Evidence-based safe infant sleep recommendations to reduce the risk of sleep- related infant death from the 2016 AAP guidelines include the following46:
a. Back to sleep during every episode of sleep.
b. Using a firm sleep surface without soft objects or loose bedding.
c. Room sharing with the infant on a separate surface, ideally for the first year of life, but at least for the first 6 months.
d. Avoidance of overheating and head covering.
e. Avoidance of alcohol, illicit drugs, and smoke exposure during preg- nancy and after birth.
f. Protective factors that should be recommended: Regular prenatal care, breastfeeding, routine immunizations.
g. Modeling of safe sleep by healthcare providers/staff, day care providers, and in advertising.
 IX. BRIEF RESOLVED UNEXPLAINED EVENT (BRUE)47,48	
A. Definition
Formerly termed an apparent life-threatening event (ALTE), a BRUE is defined as an event involving an infant below 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief (typically 20 to 30 seconds) and now resolved episode of at least one of the following:
1. Cyanosis or pallor
2. Absent, decreased, or irregular breathing
3. Marked change in muscle tone (hyper- or hypotonia)
4. Altered level of responsiveness

B. Differential Diagnosis
The three most common differential diagnoses are GER, seizure, and lower respiratory tract infection. If an explanation for the event is identified, then it is not a BRUE.

C. Management
An algorithm for the diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of BRUE patients is provided in Fig. 25.11.

b. In younger children, the common behavioral insomnias of childhood include limit-setting (bedtime resistance) and sleep-onset associa- tion disorder (night wakings). Treatment includes bedtime limits and appropriate sleep hygiene.
c. In older children, psychosocial or primary insomnia is characterized by excessive worry about sleep and the consequences of inadequate sleep. Managed with behavioral interventions.
d. Insomnia can be secondary to another sleep or medical disorder. A comprehensive evaluation is required. Referral to a sleep specialist or behavioral psychologist may be useful.
2. Nighttime fears
a. Common condition that is part of normal development and stems from cognitive development.
b. Characterized by tearful, fearful behavior at bedtime.
c. Relieved by sleeping with member of household.
d. Treatment involves reassurance, teaching coping skills, and use of security objects. Consider evaluation for anxiety disorder in older children/adolescents.
3. Nightmares
a. Frightening dreams that result in awakening from sleep.
b. Part of normal development.
c. Peak at age 6 to 10 years.
d. May be reduced by reducing stressors, avoiding exposure to frighten- ing images, and ensuring adequate sleep.
4. Delayed sleep phase syndrome
a. A circadian rhythm with a persistent, intractable shift in the sleep- wake cycle. Patients move to a late bedtime and late awakening.
b. Seen most commonly in adolescent and young adults.
c. Patients have daytime sleepiness and tardiness/absenteeism when unable to sleep during the day.
d. Treatment includes behavioral therapy, bright light exposure, and melatonin. Consider evaluation by a sleep specialist.
5. Parasomnias
a. Common and benign disorders of arousal.
b. Includes sleepwalking, night terrors, and confusional arousals.
c. Onset typically at age 4 to 6 years and usually disappear by adolescence.


d. Characterized by agitation and confusion. Child avoids comfort and does not recall event.
e. Usually occur in the first few hours of the night.
f. Treatment involves keeping child safe, ensuring adequate sleep, and avoiding triggers. Discourage parental intervention during an episode.

 I. GENERAL PEDIATRIC PRINCIPLES	
A. Limit Radiation Exposure
1. Children are at increased radiation risk given their greater lifetime expo- sure, relatively small size, increased radiosensitivity, and longer lives during which to manifest side effects.1
2. Use evidence-based imaging guidelines to guide appropriate imaging choice and minimize radiation exposure.1
3. See Table 26.1 for relative radiation by imaging study.
B. Use Imaging Judiciously
1. Minimize use of ionizing radiation when possible.
2. Limit imaging to indicated areas to improve resolution and minimize radiation exposure.
3. Provide adequate clinical background when ordering imaging studies to assist radiologist.

 II. CHOOSING THE RIGHT STUDY	
1. See Table 26.2 for descriptions of imaging modalities.
2. Computed tomography (CT) versus magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): CT is often more readily available, can be performed quickly, and does not require sedation; however, CT raises safety concerns regarding radiation exposure. MRI uses nonionizing radiation and may require sedation.1
3. Contrast: Helps distinguish selected body areas from surround- ing tissue. Oral and rectal contrast is used for bowel opacification.
Intravenous is used to opacify vascular structures and solid organs.

 III. HEAD	
Head ultrasound (HUS) can be used for infants with open anterior fonta- nelles. CT is preferred for acute situations (e.g., trauma, hemorrhage) and for evaluating bone structure or calcifications. MRI offers better soft-tissue contrast and visualization of brain anatomy and is, therefore, preferred for most nontraumatic intracranial pathology. MRI fast sequences (such as ultrafast [UF] MRI) uses specialized sequencing to assess ventricular size and shunt position without requiring sedation. Does not allow for adequate delineation and diagnosis of other brain pathology.1

A. Head Trauma
1. Preferred imaging: Noncontrast head CT. Use the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) rules to decide whether imaging is indicated (see Chapter 2).2,3
B. CSF Shunt Malfunction
1. Preferred imaging: Ultrafast brain MRI (UF MRI).
2. Other imaging: CT if UF MRI is not available or contraindicated. Shunt series (plain radiographs evaluating shunt tubing) are useful.
C. Orbital Cellulitis
1. Preferred imaging: Orbital contrast-enhanced CT (Fig. EC 26.A).4

Conventional radiography (CR) anteroposterior (AP) and lateral neck views are preferred initial imaging.5,6
A. Normal Anatomy
1. Normal anatomy (Figs. 26.1 and 26.2).
2. Reading lateral C-spine films.
a. Must visualize skull base, C1 to C7, top of T1.
b. Assess alignment by evaluating four curvilinear contour lines: anterior vertebral, posterior vertebral, spinolaminar, tips of spinous process (Fig. 26.3).
c. Evaluate vertebral bodies for fractures, displacement, subluxation, dislocations. Vertebral bodies should be same height and uniformity below C2.
d. Evaluate predental and prevertebral spaces for widening.
B. Cervical Spine Trauma
1. Initial imaging: CR, lateral and AP.
2. Other imaging: MRI if high clinical suspicion of C-spine injury without CR findings.

 FIGURE 26.2 
Normal soft tissue lateral neck radiograph. The adenoids (A) are seen at the base of the skull and are adjacent to the nasopharyngeal airway (N). More distally is the phar- ynx (P). The epiglottis (solid white arrow) is bounded superiorly by air in the vallecula. The aryepiglottic folds are thin, paired structures (dotted white arrow). The normal- sized laryngeal ventricle (black arrow) separates the false vocal cords above from the true cords below. The trachea (T) starts below the true cords. The retropharyngeal soft tissue (asterisks) is less than one-half the width of the adjacent vertebral body above C3/C4 (*) and less than the width of the adjacent vertebral body below C3/C4 (**). (Modified from Herring, W. Learning Radiology: Recognizing the Basics. 3rd ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier; 2016, Fig. 28.12.)


F. Vascular Rings and Pulmonary Slings
1. Preferred imaging: Contrast-enhanced CT angiography (CTA) or MR angiography (MRA).
2. Other imaging: Echocardiography (ECHO) in neonates and infants may be able to directly visualize vascular ring.9 Neck and chest CR may show displacement or compression of tracheal air column. Barium swal- low or UGI show extrinsic compression of esophagus.7

Normal lateral cervical spine radiograph. Four curvilinear lines can be used to help evaluate alignment: anterior vertebral line (AV), posterior vertebral line (PV), spinolaminar line (SL), posterior spinous line (PS). The retropharyngeal space should be less than one-half the width of the adjacent vertebral body above C3/C4 (white arrows) and the width of the adjacent vertebral body below C3/C4 (black arrows).


 V. CHEST	
CR used for initial imaging. CT useful for evaluating lung parenchyma, pleura, and osseous thorax; important for identifying oncologic disease.1,6 US can evaluate pleura, peripheral lung disease, and diaphragmatic motion.6
A. Normal Anatomy (Fig. 26.4 and Fig. EC 26.D)
B. Pulmonary Infections
1. Preferred imaging: CR, PA and lateral when possible.

2. Viral Infections
a. Nonspecific chest x-ray (CXR) findings (often overlaps with bacterial infections): Bilateral interstitial opacities, peribronchial thickening (cuffing), hyperinflation, subsegmental atelectasis (Fig. EC 26.E).9
3. Bacterial Pneumonia
a. CXR findings: Alveolar consolidation, air bronchograms (Fig. EC 26.F).9,10
b. Localizing pneumonia on CXR:
(1) Silhouette sign: Loss of normal borders between thoracic struc- tures of same density; used to localize lung pathology (Table 26.3).10
(2) Spine sign: Vertebral bodies of thoracic spine become less opaque (blacker) as moving inferiorly toward diaphragm.
Soft tissue or fluid density involving posterior lower lobe adds density causing spine to become more opaque (whiter) above diaphragm.1,10
c. Patterns of pneumonia
Certain radiographic patterns are highly suggestive of particular micro- organisms but impossible to identify with certainty (Table EC 26.A).10
C. Neonatal Lung Disease
1. Respiratory distress syndrome (or hyaline membrane disease): Hypoinflation, symmetrical hazy reticulogranular opacities, prominent air bronchograms, poor definition of pulmonary vessels.6-8
2. Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN): Interstitial edema, small pleural effusions, increased vascular markings, mildly enlarged cardio- thymic silhouette, hyperinflation.6,7
3. Meconium aspiration syndrome: Bilateral, asymmetric areas of hyper- inflation and atelectasis; asymmetric perihilar opacities, which can
be associated with pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or pleural effusions.7,8
4. Neonatal pneumonia: Bilateral, patchy interstitial opacities, hyperinflation.7
D. Mediastinal Masses
1. Preferred imaging: CR followed by contrast-enhanced CT.
2. Findings: Middle mediastinal masses silhouetting the heart border and aorta.1

 VI. HEART (SEE CHAPTER 7)	
ECHO is the first-line imaging modality. Cardiac MR (CMR) evaluates extracardiac anatomy; gold standard for quantifying ventricular volume, mass, and ejection fraction; creates a three-dimensional reconstructions of complex congenital heart disease (CHD) without radiation. Cardiac CT is alternative if CMR is contraindicated (see Fig. 26.4 for normal cardiac findings on CXR).1,8

CR used for initial workup; two-view studies (supine and upright) are often preferred. Decubitus and cross-table lateral views can help localize free air, foreign bodies, and enteric tubes; may replace upright view if needed.7 US is the initial modality for abdominal masses, ascites, appendicitis, abscesses, and biliary pathology.1 CT is preferred for trauma and further evaluation.1 MRI is becoming more frequently utilized, including magnetic resonance cholan- giopancreatography (MRCP) for pancreatitis, biliary pathology, and trauma; and magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) in known or suspected inflam- matory bowel disease to assess disease activity, extent of bowel involvement, and extraintestinal complications.1 Cross-sectional imaging (US, CT, or MR) is preferred for suspected inflammation, infection, tumors, and lymphade- nopathy. Upper GI (UGI) series can assess upper GI obstruction in neonates, malrotation, anatomic malformations, and motility problems.7
A. Normal Abdominal X-ray and Bowel Gas Pattern
1. Neonatal bowel gas pattern: Gas should be present in stomach by 15 minutes of life, in proximal small bowel by 30 to 60 minutes, in most of small intestine by 6 hours, and in colon by 12 to 24 hours (Fig. 26.5).6,11 Bowel loop diameter and bowel wall thickness should be uniform.5
2. After infancy, pockets of gas should be visualized in small bowel, colon, and rectum.
3. Small bowel seen if contains gas, located centrally, has valvulae (extends across bowel), normal diameter smaller than 3 cm.
4. Large bowel contains gas and stool, located peripherally, has haustra (extends partially across bowel), normal diameter smaller than 5 cm.
B. Pneumoperitoneum (Free Intraperitoneal Air)
1. Preferred imaging: CR including upright imaging (cross-table or decubi- tus lateral if patient unable to stand or sit).
2. Other imaging: CT confirms diagnosis, detects small amounts of air not seen on CR.10
3. Findings: Air under diaphragm
a. Continuous diaphragm sign: Air under entire diaphragm, including underneath heart silhouette

Normal bowel gas progression in neonates as seen on abdominal radiograph at 2 hours of life (A) and 24 hours of life (B). Note that by 12 hours of life air should have progressed through small bowel and by 24 hours of life (B) air can be visualized in the rectum.


b. Falciform ligament sign: Ability to visualize normally invisible falci- form ligament as free air surrounds ligament (Fig. EC 26.G)
c. Football sign: Oval appearance of abdominal cavity outlined by gas with visualization of falciform ligament, seen in massive pneumoperi- toneum (see Fig. EC 26.G)10
C. Neonatal Enterocolitis (see Chapter 18)
1. Initial imaging: CR, include cross-table lateral or left decubitus views to evaluate for free air.7
2. Other imaging: Intestinal US if high clinical suspicion for NEC and CR non- specific or inconclusive, as can depict changes in intra-abdominal fluid, bowel wall thickness, and bowel wall perfusion before findings on CR.12
3. CR findings: Nonspecific signs: Diffuse gaseous distention (most common), loss of normal symmetrical distribution of gas, persistence of single dilated bowel loop (fixed loop sign). Pathognomonic signs: Pneumatosis intestinalis (intramural gas with "bubbly" appearance commonly in distal small bowel and colon), portal venous gas (branch- ing lucencies seen projecting over liver) (Fig. 26.6).7
D. Neonatal Intestinal Obstruction
1. Difficult to distinguish small from large bowel in neonates.5
2. Initial imaging: CR to decipher high obstruction (stomach to proximal ileum) from low obstruction (distal ileum to colon).
3. Further imaging: UGI series or esophagram (obstruction proximal to ligament of Treitz), UGI series with small bowel follow-through (liga- ment of Treitz to ileocecal junction), contrast enema (distal to ileocecal junction).5,7,9
4. High intestinal obstruction
a. CR findings: Few dilated loops of bowel.
b. Duodenal atresia: Double bubble on CR (Fig. EC 26.H), reflecting air in dilated stomach and proximal duodenum with absence of air dis- tally. If partial obstruction, UGI series further differentiates duodenal stenosis or web from midgut volvulus.7
c. Malrotation: Malpositioned duodenojejunal junction/ligament of Treitz (normally at level of duodenal bulb and to left of spine). UGI series is the gold standard. US can be used for rapid screening.5,7
5. Low intestinal obstruction
a. CR findings: Multiple dilated loops of bowel; assess further with contrast enema.
b. Ileal atresia: Contrast enema shows opacification of diffusely small caliber large bowel (microcolon). Contrast refluxes into distal ileum, but unable to reflux further. Bowel proximal to distal ileum is air filled and dilated.
c. Hirschsprung disease: Contrast enema shows "transition zone" between nondilated aganglionic distal colon and normal, relatively distended, proximal colon.7

Free intraperitoneal air. An anteroposterior supine abdominal radiograph in a baby with necrotizing enterocolitis and free air demonstrates generalized lucency throughout the abdomen. Note that free air outlines the falciform ligament ("football sign") (arrow), and air is seen on both sides of the bowel wall ("Rigler sign") (double arrows). (From Walters, MM, Robertson RL. Pediatric Radiology: The Requisites. 4th ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier; 2017, p. 93, Fig. 4.4.)

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in a premature infant. Radiography shows multiple dilatated bowel loops with multiple areas of linear lucency (arrows) along the bowel wall, consistent with pneumatosis. Note portal venous gas (arrowheads) as branching, tubular lucencies overlying the liver. (From Donnelly, LF. Fundamentals of Pediatric Imaging. 2nd ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier; 2017, p. 92, Fig. 5.1.)

d. Meconium ileus: Contrast enema shows opacification of diffusely small caliber large bowel. Contrast refluxes into nondilated terminal ileum, which contains impacted meconium pellets. Bowel proximal to terminal ileum is dilated.5
E. Pyloric Stenosis
1. Preferred imaging: Upper abdominal US.
2. Findings: Abnormal thickening of pyloric muscle (=3 mm) and elonga- tion of pyloric channel (>15 to 17 mm).10
F. Intussusception
1. Preferred imaging: RUQ US.1
2. Findings: Donut, target, or pseudo-kidney sign.1
3. Treatment: Pneumatic enema reduction under fluoroscopic guidance.1


G. Ileus
1. Preferred imaging: CR.
2. Findings: Small and large bowel distention.1,10
H. Mechanical Bowel Obstruction
1. Initial imaging: CR. Supine view for identifying gas pattern. Upright/ erect, cross-table lateral, or lateral decubitus for identifying free air and air-fluid levels.
2. Other imaging: CT with oral contrast determines obstruction site. CT with IV contrast to detect complications such as ischemia.10 Note: CR has low sensitivity for identifying bowel obstruction; therefore, CT should be obtained if obstruction clinically suspected.
3. Findings: Dilated loops of bowel proximal to obstruction, little to no air in rectum.1
a. Small bowel obstruction: Numerous air-fluid levels. Distended bowel normally more central.
b. Large bowel obstruction: Few to no air-fluid levels. Distended bowel normally more peripheral.
I. Appendicitis
1. Preferred imaging: RLQ US.
2. Other imaging: MRI if US equivocal. CT only if MRI unavailable or patient unstable or cannot tolerate MRI.1,7
3. US findings: Fluid-filled, noncompressible, blind-ending tubular struc- ture greater than 6 mm in diameter.1,7
J. Esophageal Foreign Bodies
1. Preferred imaging: CR, evaluate entire GI tract (AP/lateral neck, chest, abdomen).
2. Other imaging: Esophagram with water-soluble contrast if suspicion high but CR negative.7
3. Findings: Most commonly lodged at thoracic inlet. Only radiopaque objects can be visualized on CR. May see mass effect on adjacent structures from swelling caused by foreign body.
a. Coins (most common): Flat object on frontal view with edge visual- ized on lateral.
b. Disk batteries: Bilaminar structure, must identify as may cause seri- ous chemical injury.7
K. Abdominal Trauma
1. Preferred imaging: CT with IV contrast.
2. Other imaging: If hemodynamically unstable, rapid bedside US using focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) protocol to evaluate for free fluid.7 FAST evaluates bilateral upper quadrants, bilat- eral pericolic gutters, pelvis, and pericardium.1
L. Gallbladder Disease
1. Preferred imaging: US. Patients should fast for 6 hours prior to allow for gallbladder filling.1
