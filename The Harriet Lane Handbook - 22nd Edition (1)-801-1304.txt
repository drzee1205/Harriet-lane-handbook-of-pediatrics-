
2. Findings: Posterior acoustic shadowing in cholelithiasis. Nonshadowing echogenic foci if stone disease, polyps, other masses. Gallbladder wall thickening (>3 mm), positive sonographic Murphy's sign (localized tenderness with transducer palpation over gallbladder), sludge, and pericholecystic fluid with cholelithiasis in acute cholecystitis.1
M. Pancreatitis
1. Initial imaging: US.
2. Other imaging: CT with IV contrast if lack of clinical improvement or equivocal US. MRCP for detecting choledocholithiasis and biliary/pan- creatic duct anomalies.13
3. US findings: Pancreatic duct dilation, abnormal echogenicity, peripan- creatic fluid.1,7

 VIII. GENITOURINARY TRACT	
Renal and bladder ultrasound (RBUS): first-line imaging modality; evaluates kidneys, ureters, and bladder; can assess calculi. Fluoroscopic voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG), radionuclide cystourethrography (RNC), and contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography (ceVUS) assess for vesicoureteral reflux. Nuclear renal scintigraphy (Mag-3 scan) assesses renal perfusion, function, and excretion. Cross-sectional imaging (CT, MR, MR urography) assesses for genitourinary (GU) tract tumors or obstruction. Additionally, MR urography can evaluate renal function and unenhanced CT can assess collecting system calculi.7
A. Urinary Tract Infection
See Chapter 19.
B. Nephrolithiasis/Urolithiasis
1. Preferred imaging: US
2. Other imaging: Noncontrast CT if US equivocal.1,7
3. US findings: Echogenic, shadowing foci.7
4. CT findings: Radiodense stones, dilated ureteral or collection system, asymmetric enlargement of kidney.1
C. Testicular Pathology
1. Preferred imaging: Duplex US.1
2. Testicular torsion findings: Absence of blood flow to center of testicle.1
3. Acute epididymitis findings: Enlarged epididymis, scrotal thickening, reactive hydrocele, increased blood flow.1
D. Ovarian Pathology
1. Preferred imaging: Pelvic US.
2. Ovarian cyst findings: Well-circumscribed anechoic structures within pelvis measuring more than 3 cm in diameter. Hyperechoic material within cyst indicates possible hemorrhage.9
3. Ovarian torsion findings: Variable appearance, usually unilateral enlarged solid ovary with multiple peripheral follicles.9 Absence or presence of flow on duplex not a reliable indicator of torsion.7


E. Congenital Hydronephrosis
1. Normally first detected on fetal US, defined as AP renal pelvis diameter greater than 4 mm in second trimester and greater than 7 mm in third trimester.
2. Preferred imaging: US to confirm postnatally, as can resolve spontane- ously. Do not perform until at least 48 hours after delivery given risk of false negatives or underestimation of severity.1
3. Findings: Moderate-to-severe hydronephrosis (>10 mm) with clinical suspicion or family history warrants further evaluation with VCUG. Repeat US at age 4 to 6 weeks to confirm absence of hydronephrosis.1,14

 IX. MUSCULOSKELETAL	
CR is the primary imaging modality; used in trauma, infection, and suspected bone lesions.7 MRI provides superior contrast resolution of soft tissue and bone marrow; preferred for patellar dislocation and avulsion fractures. Use IV contrast to delineate inflammation, ischemia, revascularization, and tumors.1 US used for superficial soft-tissue masses and suspected joint effusions.
A. Fractures and Trauma
1. Preferred imaging: CR. For long bones, obtain at least two projections. For joints, obtain at least three projections and evaluate proximal and distal joint. Fractures may not be seen on initial XR; consider repeat XRs in 7 to 10 days as may visualize periosteal reactions around healing fracture.1,7
2. Findings: Abrupt disruption of the cortex or acute angulation of smooth contour of normal bone.10 Indirect signs: soft-tissue swelling, joint effu- sion, periosteal reaction (if subacute or healing).
3. Describing fractures.10
a. Location: Laterality, location on bone, relation to joint (intra-articular, extra-articular).
b. Type: Complete (through whole cortex), incomplete (retains some continuity [e.g., plastic, bowing, torus, greenstick]), Salter-Harris (involves growth plate) (Table 26.4)
c. Number of fragments: Simple (two fragments) or comminuted (>2).
d. Direction of fracture lines: Transverse (perpendicular to long axis), oblique/diagonal (diagonal in orientation relative to long axis), spiral (corkscrew, twisting).
e. Relationship (distal fracture fragment to proximal fragment): Displacement (amount distal fragment is offset in nonlongitudinal axis), angulation (angle between fragments), apposition (amount of contact between fragments), shortening (amount of overlap between fragments, change in bone length), distraction (distance fragments are separated in longitudinal axis), rotation (orientation of joint at one end of fracture relative to joint at other end).
f. Open versus closed: Open or compound (communication between fracture and outside atmosphere), closed or simple.

4. Common pediatric fracture patterns: see Chapter 2.
5. Elbow XRs.
a. Anterior humeral line: Line drawn tangential to anterior humeral cortex should bisect middle third of capitellum. If line more anterior, supracondylar fracture should be suspected (Figs. 26.7 and 26.8).10
b. Radiocapitellar line: Line drawn through the center of radial neck should pass through the center of capitellum. If it does not, disloca- tion should be suspected (see Figs. 26.7 and 26.8).14
c. Ossification centers: Mnemonic CRITOE commonly used to remember sequential order of appearance (Table EC 26.B and Fig. EC 26.I).15
d. Fat pad: Normal lateral view of flexed elbow shows only anterior fat pad (lucency). Elevated anterior fat pad and visible posterior fat pad indicates intra-articular injury and possible radial head fracture (posi- tive fat-pad sign) (Fig. 26.9).12
e. Hourglass sign ('figure-of-eight'): On a true lateral view, an hour- glass or figure-of-eight configuration can be visualized on the distal humerus (see Fig. 26.9).
B. Osteomyelitis
1. Initial imaging: CR. Findings often lag 7 to 14 days after symptom onset; however, may rule out or identify alternative diagnosis.1
2. Preferred imaging: MRI. Findings can be seen as early as 24 to 48 hours after symptom onset.1,16
3. Findings: Metaphysis of long bones most frequently affected. CR: soft- tissue swelling, bony destruction, cortical loss, periosteal reaction.16
C. Hip Disorders
1. Developmental dysplasia of the hip
a. Preferred imaging: US, typically around 6 weeks of age.
b. Other imaging: Once femoral heads ossify (within 3 to 6 months), CR more helpful.7

Normal elbow alignment on lateral radiograph. The anterior humeral line (black arrow) is drawn along the anterior cortex of the humerus and should intersect the middle third of the capitellum (asterisk). The radiocapitellar line (white arrow) is drawn along the axis of the radius. (Modified from Coley, BD. Caffey's Pediatric Diagnostic Imaging. 13th ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier; 2019, p. 1439, Fig. 142.19.)

2. Idiopathic avascular necrosis of femoral head (Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease).
a. Initial imaging: CR, AP pelvis and frog-leg lateral hip.
b. Other imaging: MRI, more sensitive for early disease, useful if CR is nondiagnostic.7
c. Findings: Small capital femoral epiphysis, sclerotic femoral head, widened joint space, curvilinear subchondral lucency from subchon- dral fracture (crescent sign).7
3. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE)
a. Initial imaging: CR, AP and frog-leg lateral views of pelvis.
b. Findings: Asymmetric widening and/or lucency of proximal femoral physis, posterior and inferomedial displacement of femoral head rela- tive to femoral neck (ice cream falling off cone). Can assess femoral head position by drawing line along lateral aspect of the femoral neck (Klein's line), which should intersect the capital femoral epiphysis in normal anatomy (Fig. EC 26.J).7

Pathologic lesions: not well demarcated from surrounding normal bone, possible accompany- ing soft-tissue mass, periosteal reaction, destructive bone changes. (Fig. EC 26.K to Fig. EC 26.O).1
F. Skeletal Survey in Suspected Nonaccidental Trauma
1. Imaging: CR at presentation and 2 weeks after presentation. Follow-up surveys may identify initially missed trauma by identifying healing frac- tures (Fig. EC 26.P).5
2. Evaluate for fractures inconsistent with history or developmental stage. Certain findings suspicious for nonaccidental trauma (NAT) (see Chapter 2).

4. Xerostomia (dry mouth from decreased salivary gland production).
5. May present as parotid gland swelling in children.

Most laboratory studies used to diagnose rheumatic diseases are nonspe- cific, and results must be interpreted within the context of the full clinical picture. Once a diagnosis is established, however, they can be used to follow the condition's clinical course, indicating flares or remission of the rheumatic disease.
A. Acute-Phase Reactants
Indicate presence of inflammation when elevated. Elevation is nonspecific and can result from trauma, infection, rheumatic diseases, or malignancy.1 Markers include erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), platelet count, ferritin, haptoglobin, fibrinogen, serum amyloid A, and complement.1,6

GI, Gastrointestinal; URI, upper respiratory infection.



1. ESR
a. Measure of the rate of fall of red blood cells in anticoagulated blood within a vertical tube; reflects level of rouleaux formation caused by acute-phase reactants.1
b. Can be falsely lowered in afibrinogenemia, polycythemia, and sickle cell disease; these states interfere with rouleaux formation.2
c. Can be outside normal range for age due to obesity, pregnancy, and anemia.29
d. Serial measurements may help in monitoring disease severity or activity in conditions such as SLE and JIA.


2. CRP1,30
a. Synthesized by the liver, assists in clearance of pathologic bacteria and damaged cells via activation of complement-mediated phagocy- tosis, and mediates acute inflammation by altering cytokine release.
b. Increases and decreases rapidly owing to short half-life (approxi- mately 18 hours).14
c. Elevation is nonspecific, indicating only inflammation:
(1) Most active phases of rheumatic disease result in elevation to 1 to 10 mg/dL.
(2) Level greater than 10 mg/dL raises concern for bacterial infection or systemic vasculitis.31
B. Autoantibodies (Table 27.3)14
The positive predictive value of any autoantibody assay depends on clinical context. These studies can prove valuable in confirming clinical suspicion. Sensitivities and specificities must be considered with any clinical decision.
1. Antinuclear antibody (ANA)
a. ANA is a nonspecific test for SLE and other rheumatic disease.1
b. Positive in approximately 60% to 70% of children with an auto- immune disease, but can be seen in about 25% of the normal population.32,33
c. If positive, consider ordering individual autoantibodies.6
d. Can be positive in nonrheumatologic diseases33:
(1) Malignancy (e.g., acute lymphoblastic leukemia)
(2) Infections (transiently positive): Mononucleosis, endocarditis, hepatitis, malaria
e. If positive in JIA, there is increased risk of chronic uveitis.29
2. Rheumatoid factor (RF)1,29
a. M antibodies to the Fc portion of IgG.
b. Positive in rheumatic and nonrheumatic diseases:
(1) Rheumatic diseases: Rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, mixed con- nective tissue disease, scleroderma, and primary Sjögren syndrome.
(2) Infections: Hepatitis B/C, subacute bacterial endocarditis, tuber- culosis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes.
c. Negative RF does not rule out rheumatic disease.
d. Prognostic importance in polyarticular JIA: Positive RF suggests more aggressive disease.29
3. Anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies
a. Known to be highly specific for rheumatoid arthritis in adults; found primarily in children with polyarticular JIA.29
b. Anti-CCP positivity correlates with erosive joint disease in JIA.34,35

C. Complement1,5
The complement system is composed of a series of plasma proteins and cellular receptors that function together to mediate host defense and inflammation. Inflammatory processes may increase the synthesis of complement proteins or increase their consumption.
1. Total hemolytic complement level (CH50)
a. Immune complex disease leads to depletion of complement compo- nents and decreased level of CH50.
b. Increased in the acute phase response of numerous inflammatory states.
c. Useful screening test for homozygous complement deficiency states which have the strongest association with SLE.29
d. Typically decreased in SLE, acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephri- tis, subacute bacterial endocarditis.14
2. C3 and C4
a. Most common complement proteins assayed.
b. May be increased or decreased in rheumatic diseases, depending on disease stage or severity.
c. Decreased levels of complement proteins:
(1) Indicator of immune complex formation.
(2) Complete deficiency of C3 manifests as severe, recurrent infec- tions with pyogenic organisms.14
(3) Can occur in active SLE, some vasculitides, and multiple infec- tions, including gram-negative sepsis, hepatitis, and pneumococ- cal infections.
(4) Decreased levels typically signify more severe SLE, particularly with regard to renal disease.
(5) Persistently low C3 associated with lupus nephritis.
(6) Severe hepatic failure: Synthesis of complement proteins occurs primarily in the liver.
(7) Congenital complement deficiency, which may predispose to development of autoimmune disease.
d. Increased levels of complement proteins:
(1) Indicates the active phase of most rheumatic diseases (e.g., JIA, dermatomyositis).
(2) May be seen in multiple infections (e.g., hepatitis, pneumococcal pneumonia) as part of the acute-phase response.

A. Vaccination
1. Patients on immunosuppressive therapies cannot receive live vaccines, but can receive killed/inactivated vaccines.
2. Special considerations should be made for immunocompromised patients on biologic or immunosuppressive therapy (see Chapter 16).

B. Weight Management
1. Obesity and cushingoid fat distribution often result from chronic steroid use.
2. In addition to physical health consequences, this may also cause psy- chologic issues.
C. Bone and Skin Health
1. Patients with arthritis or on chronic steroids are at increased risk of osteopenia. Ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D intake and weight- bearing activities.
2. Patients with SLE and dermatomyositis are particularly vulnerable to ultraviolet radiation. They should not be exposed to the sun without wearing a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high sun-protection factor (SPF) and should not use tanning booths.
D. Reproductive Health
1. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologics, espe- cially methotrexate, are teratogenic.
2. Teenage patients should receive counseling on the use of contraception.
E. Other Aspects of Primary Care Coordination
1. Children with JIA have an increased risk of developing uveitis, which is often insidious and asymptomatic. Routine pediatric ophthalmologic screening is required.37
a. The first ophthalmologic exam should occur within 1 month of diagnosis.
b. In active disease, exams should occur every 3 months regardless of ANA status.
c. In inactive disease, frequency varies based on ANA status, disease duration, and age of diagnosis.
2. Patients require supportive therapies in the form of physical therapy, occupational therapy, and input from rehabilitation specialists, psy- chologists, and social workers.
F. Laboratory Monitoring

   Determining normal reference ranges of laboratory studies in pediatric patients poses some major challenges. Available literature is often limited due to small sample sizes of patients used to derive these suggested refer- ence ranges.
   The following values have been compiled from both published literature and the Johns Hopkins Hospital Department of Pathology. Reference range values vary with the analytic method used. Consult your laboratory for its analytic method and range of reference values, and for less com- monly used parameters that are beyond the scope of this text. Additional reference laboratory values may be found in Chapters 10 (Endocrinology), Chapter 14 (Hematology), and Chapter 15 (Immunology and Allergy).

 I. EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE	
Evidence-based medicine refers to the method of integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available evidence from the literature. The following is a framework on how to formulate a clinical question and appraise the evidence1:
A. Formulate the Clinical Question (PICO Process)
1. P: Describe the patient or problem, deciding whether the evidence you seek is regarding therapy, diagnosis, prognosis, etiology, or cost effectiveness.
2. I: Describe the intervention under consideration.
3. C: Compare the intervention with an alternative or current standard of care.
4. O: Formulate a specific outcome of interest.
B. Search for the Evidence to Answer the Question
1. Define search terms that fit the clinical question.
2. Develop your search strategy using primary search sources such as PubMed and secondary sources such as Cochrane.
3. Review your results, and apply methodological filters to target the right type of study.
C. Critically Appraise the Evidence
1. Therapy
a. Were patient groups randomized for treatment?
b. Were groups comparable and treated equally, aside from the allo- cated treatment?
c. Were study subjects and investigators blinded?
d. Were all patients entering the trial accounted for in the groups they were randomized to (intention to treat)?
e. How large was the treatment effect?
2. Diagnosis
a. Was the test compared with an independent reference standard?
b. Was the test evaluated in an appropriate spectrum of patients?
3. Prognosis
a. Were study patients defined early in their course and followed up over a sufficient time?
b. How likely is it that the outcomes occur during a defined time period?
c. How precise are the estimates of prognosis?


4. Guidelines for judging causality between a variable and outcome2
a. Is there a temporal relationship?
b. What is the strength of association?
c. Is there a dose-response relationship?
d. Were the findings replicated?
e. Are the findings biologically plausible?
f. What happens with cessation of exposure?
g. Is this explanation consistent with other knowledge?
5. Bias: Consider these types of bias that may influence results or distort statistical findings2:
a. Selection bias: Caused by a nonrandom or dissimilar sample (between cases/controls or exposed/unexposed) from a population. Examples include sampling bias, loss to follow-up, and exclusion bias. Mitigated by randomization and selection of participants who are representative of the target population.
b. Information bias: Caused by flawed collection of information about exposures or outcomes. Examples include recall bias, observer bias, and lead-time bias. Mitigated by blinding researchers to subject status and standardizing data collection procedures.
D. Apply the Evidence to the Clinical Question
If the evidence is valid and important, integrate it with your clinical exper- tise and decide whether:
1. The patient will benefit from the therapy and be able to tolerate potential harms.
2. The test is available, affordable, accurate, and precise.

 II. BIOSTATISTICS AND EPIDEMIOLOGY	
A. Statistical Tests
The following statistical tests are used to determine whether observed dif- ferences are statistically significant (Table 29.1).3-5
1. Parametric tests are used when data follow a particular distribution (e.g., a normal distribution-a bell-shaped distribution where the median, mean, and mode are all equal). These tests are generally more powerful.
2. Nonparametric tests are used when a particular distribution cannot be assumed; they rank data rather than taking absolute differences into account.
3. Unpaired tests compare values from independent samples.
4. Paired tests are performed on paired data. For example, where the same parameter is measured on each patient before and after an intervention.
5. Two-tailed tests should be used when an intervention could potentially lead to either an increase or decrease of the outcome.
6. One-tailed tests should be used when an intervention can have only one plausible effect on the outcome.

B. Statistical Terminology
1. a (Alpha): Significance level of a statistical test3,6
a. a: Probability of making a type I error; the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true (i.e., a difference is seen by chance alone).


b. a is typically set at less than 0.05 in medical research, which allows interpretation with 95% certainty that a detected associa- tion is true.
c. The P value is the probability of obtaining the observed values if the null hypothesis is true. For example, if P = 0.01, there is a 1 in 100 chance of the values being from chance alone. The P value is judged against a, the preset level of significance. If P is less than the significance level a, the detected association is considered significant.
2. ß (Beta): Power of a statistical test
a. ß: Probability of making a type II error; the probability of accepting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true (i.e., no difference is seen even though there is one).
b. Power = 1 - ß: Probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis (i.e., finding a difference when there truly is one).
c. Power is typically set at a minimum of 0.80, which allows inter- pretation with 80% certainty that a detected lack of association is true.
3. Sample size: The number of subjects required in a study to detect an effect with a predetermined power and a.
4. 95% confidence interval: Describes the values between which there is a 95% chance that the true population value falls. When confidence intervals for groups overlap, they have no statistically significant difference.
5. Confounder: A variable associated with both the disease and the exposure (risk factor), leading to detection of a false relationship between the disease and exposure if the confounder is not accounted for. Can be controlled for by adjustment, matching, blinding, and randomization.
6. Effect modifier (interaction): A variable that modifies the observed effect of an exposure on disease. For example, if a new drug is effective in female children but not male children, then sex is an effect modifier. Can be controlled by stratification.
C. Types of Study Designs7 (see Table 29.2)
D. Measurement of Disease Occurrence and Treatment Effects2:
See Table 29.3 for equations in this section.
1. Prevalence: Proportion of population who has a disease at a point in time. Obtained in cross-sectional studies.
Prevalence = Number of total cases
Population size
2. Incidence: Rate of people developing a disease in the population during a defined time period. Obtained in cohort studies and clinical trials.
Incidence = Number of new cases per unit of time Population size

Also known as a contingency table.

3. Relative risk (RR): The ratio of incidence of disease among people with an exposure to incidence of disease among people without the expo- sure. Obtained in cohort studies and clinical trials; cannot be obtained in case-control studies.

RR =

a. RR = 1: No effect of exposure or treatment on outcome
b. RR <1: Exposure or treatment protective against outcome
c. RR >1: Exposure or treatment increases the outcome
d. The relative risk reduction (RRR), which measures the strength of the impact of an exposure or treatment, is equal to 1 - RR.
4. Odds ratio (OR): The ratio of the odds of an exposed person developing a disease to the odds of a nonexposed person developing the disease. Obtained in case-control studies, cohort studies, and clinical trials.



OR =

= A × D B ×C

a. OR approximates RR when the disease is rare (incidence <0.10)
b. OR =1: No association between risk factor and disease
c. OR <1: Suggests that risk factor is protective against disease
d. OR >1: Suggests positive association between risk factor and disease
5. Risk difference: The difference between the risk of the outcome in control and the risk of the outcome in treatment group. If the risk of the outcome is decreased by the treatment, absolute risk reduction (ARR) is used. If the risk of the outcome is increased by the treatment, absolute risk increase (ARI) is used.
ARR =   C	 -   A	
(C +D ) (A +B )
ARI =   A	 -  C	
(A +B ) (C +D )
6. Number needed to treat (NNT): Number of patients who need to be treated to prevent one undesired outcome, expressed as the inverse of ARR.
NNT = 1 ARR

E. Measurements of Test Performance2
See Table 29.4 for equations in this section.
1. Validity: The ability of a test to indicate which patients have or do not have disease. Intrinsic to the test-not affected by disease prevalence.
a. Sensitivity: Proportion of all patients with disease who have a posi- tive test. Measures the ability of the test to correctly identify those who have the disease. Use a highly sensitive test to help rule out a disease. Good for screening.
Sensitivity =	TP
TP + FN
b. Specificity: Proportion of all patients without disease who have a negative test. Measures the ability of the test to correctly identify those who do not have the disease. Use a highly specific test to help confirm a disease.
Speci?city =	TN
TN + FP
2. Positive predictive value (PPV): Proportion of those with positive tests who truly have disease. PPV is increased with higher disease prevalence.
PPV =		TP TP + FP
3. Negative predictive value (NPV): Proportion of those with negative tests who truly do not have disease. NPV is increased with lower disease prevalence.
NPV =		TN TN + FN
4. Likelihood ratio (LR): Incorporates the validity of a test (sensitivity and specificity) to determine the magnitude of the effect of a test result on changing the pretest probability. Used with Bayes nomogram (Fig. 29.1)

Discontinue use at the first appearance of skin rash or other signs of an allergic reaction. Avoid use in individuals with HLA-B*58:01 allele as they are at significant risk for developing severe cutaneous adverse reactions (e.g., Stevens Johnson
Syndrome and TEN). Side effects include rash, neuritis, hepatotoxicity, GI disturbance, bone marrow suppression, and drowsiness. Adjust dose in renal insufficiency (see Chapter 31). Must maintain adequate urine output and alkaline urine.
Drug interactions: increases serum theophylline level; may increase the incidence of rash with ampicillin and amoxicillin; increased risk of toxicity with azathioprine, didanosine and mercaptopurine; and increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions with ACE inhibitors and thiazide diuretics. Use with didanosine is contraindicated due to increased risk for didanosine toxicity. Rhabdomyolysis has been reported with clarithromycin use. IV dosage form is very alkaline and must be diluted to a minimum concentration of 6 mg/mL and infused over 30 min.

 IV. EXPLANATION OF PREGNANCY CATEGORIES	
A Adequate studies in pregnant women have not demonstrated a risk to the fetus in the first trimester of pregnancy, and there is no evidence of risk in later trimesters.
B Animal studies have not demonstrated a risk to the fetus, but there are no adequate studies in pregnant women; or animal studies have shown an adverse effect, but adequate studies in pregnant women have not demonstrated a risk to the fetus during the first trimester of pregnancy, and there is no evidence of risk in later trimesters.
C Animal studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus, but there are no adequate studies in humans; or there are no animal reproduction studies and no adequate studies in humans.
D There is evidence of human fetal risk, but the potential benefits from the use of the drug in pregnant women may be acceptable despite its potential risks.
X Studies in animals or humans demonstrate fetal abnormalities or adverse reaction; reports indicate evidence of fetal risk. The risk of use in pregnant women clearly outweighs any possible benefit.

ACETAMINOPHEN continued
May be used for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus when standard NSAID is contraindicated or has failed. Most commonly reported dosage is 15 mg/kg dose Q6 hr IV/PO for 3 days (may be given up to 7 days or with a repeated 3-day course).
May decrease the activity of lamotrigine and increase the activity/toxicity of busulfan, warfarin, and zidovudine. Barbiturates, phenytoin, rifampin, and anticholinergic agents (e.g., scopolamine) may decrease the effect of acetaminophen. Increased risk for hepatotoxicity may occur with barbitu- rates, carbamazepine, phenytoin, carmustine (with high acetaminophen doses), chronic alcohol use, and inducers of CYP 450 2E1 (e.g., isoniazid). Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).
FOR IV USE: administer dose undiluted over 15 min. Most common side effects with IV use include nausea, vomiting, constipation, pruritus, agitation and atelectasis in children; and nausea, vomiting, headache and insomnia in adults. Rare risk of serious skin reactions (e.g., SJS, TEN) has been reported.

Urine alkalization:
Adult: 5 mg/kg/dose PO repeated BID-TID over 24 hr.
Management of hydrocephalus (see remarks): Start with 20 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q8 hr PO/IV; may increase to 100 mg/kg/24 hr up to a max. dose of 2 g/24 hr
Pseudotumor cerebri (PO; see remarks):
Child: Start with 25 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ once daily-QID, increase by 25 mg/kg/24 hr until clinical response or as tolerated up to a maximum of 100 mg/kg/24 hr.
Adolescent: Start with 1 g/24 hr ÷ once daily-QID, increase by 250 mg/24 hr until clinical response or as tolerated up to a maximum of 4 g/24 hr.
Contraindicated in hepatic failure, severe renal failure (GFR <10 mL/min), and hypersensitivity to sulfonamides.
T1/2: 2-6 hr; do not use sustained release capsules in seizures; IM injection may be painful; bicarbon- ate replacement therapy may be required during long-term use (see Citrate or Sodium Bicarbonate).

ACETAZOLAMIDE continued
Possible side effects (more likely with long-term therapy) include GI irritation, paresthesias, sedation, hypokalemia, acidosis, reduced urate secretion, aplastic anemia, polyuria, and development of renal calculi.
May increase toxicity of carbamazepine, and cyclosporine. Aspirin may increase toxicity of acetazol- amide. May decrease the effects of salicylates, lithium and phenobarbital. False-positive urinary protein may occur with several assays. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).

OPHTHALMIC:
Herpes simplex keratitis (=2 yr and adolescent): Apply 1 cm (1/2-inch) ribbon onto the lower eyelid of affected eye(s) 5 times a day while awake (~Q3 hr) until corneal ulcer heals then reduce dosage to TID for 7 days.
See most recent edition of the AAP Red Book for further details. Use with caution in patients with preexisting neurologic or renal impairment (adjust dose; see Chapter 31) or dehydration. Adequate hydration and slow (1 hr) IV administration are essential to prevent
crystallization in renal tubules. Do not use topical product on the eye or for the prevention of recurrent HSV infections. Oral absorption is unpredictable (15%-30%); consider using valacyclovir or famciclovir for better absorption. Use ideal body weight for obese patients when calculating dosages. Resistant strains of HSV and VZV have been reported in immunocompromised patients (e.g., advanced HIV infection).
Inflammation or phlebitis at the injection site and transient elevations of sCr and BUN are the most frequent IV use side effects. Can cause renal impairment and has been associated with headache, ver- tigo, insomnia, encephalopathy, GI tract irritation, elevated liver function tests, rash, urticaria, arthral- gia, fever, and adverse hematologic effects. Probenecid decreases acyclovir renal clearance. Acyclovir may increase the concentration of tenofovir, and meperidine and its metabolite (normeperidine).
Topical cream acyclovir 5% in combination with hydrocortisone 1% (Xerese) is indicated for herpes labialis (=6 yr and adults) at a dosage of 5 applications per day for 5 days. Use a finger cot or rubber glove when applying topical cream or ointment.
Ophthalmic ointment: patient should close his or her eyes for 1-2 min after each application and wipe away any excess ointment. Most common side effects include stinging, punctuate keratitis, and follicular conjunctivitis. Blepharitis and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported.

Epiduo Forte: 0.3% adapalene +2.5% benzoyl peroxide (15, 30, 45, 60, 70 g)
Adapalene (=12 yr and adult): Apply a thin film of cream, gel or lotion to affected areas of cleansed and dried skin QHS
Adapalene and benzoyl peroxide: Apply a thin film to affected areas of cleansed and dried skin once daily
Epiduo: Indicated for children =9 yr and adults with limited data in children 7-<9 yr
Epiduo Forte: Indicated for children =12 yr and adults.
Avoid contact with eyes, mucous membranes, abraded skin and open wounds; excessive sun exposure; and use of other irritating topical products. A mild transitory warm or stinging
sensation of the skin may occur during the first 4 wk of use. Clean and dry the skin before each use.
ADAPALENE: Onset of therapeutic benefits seen in 8-12 wk. Common side effects include dry skin, erythema, and scaly skin. When compared with tretinoin in clinical trials for acne vulgaris, ada- palene was as effective and had a more rapid onset of clinical effects with less skin irritation.
ADAPALENE + BENZOYL PEROXIDE: Onset of therapeutic benefits seen in 4-8 wk. Side effects reported in placebo-controlled studies include dry skin, erythema, skin irritation, and contact dermatitis. When compared with isotretinoin in a clinical trial for nodulocystic acne, adapalene + benzoyl peroxide plus doxycycline was not inferior to isotretinoin and was less effective in reducing the number of total lesions (nodules, papules/pustules, and comedones).

Inhaled doses may be given more frequently than indicated. In such cases, consider cardiac monitoring and monitoring of serum potassium (hypokalemia). Systemic effects are dose related. Please verify the concentration of the nebulization solution used.
Safety and efficacy for the treatment of symptoms or bronchospasms associated with obstructive airway disease have not been demonstrated for children <4 yr of age (either dose studied was not optimal in this age or drug is not effective in this age group).
Use of oral dosage form is discouraged due to increased side effects and decreased efficacy com- pared with inhaled formulations.
Possible side effects include tachycardia, palpitations, tremor, insomnia, nervousness, nausea, and headache.
The use of tube spacers or chambers may enhance efficacy of the HFA metered dose inhalers and have been proven to be just as effective and sometimes safer than nebulizers. Do not use a spacer device with any of the breath activated inhaler dosage forms. Breath-activated dosage forms require patients to generate a minimum inspiratory flow rate of =30 L/min for proper dose activation.

Note: Pharmacy may dilute IV dosage forms to enhance accuracy of neonatal dosing.
Neonatal apnea:
Loading dose: 5-6 mg/kg IV
Maintenance dose: 1-2 mg/kg/dose Q6-8 hr, IV
Asthma exacerbation and reactive airway disease:
IV loading: 6 mg/kg IV over 20 min (each 1.2 mg/kg dose raises the serum theophylline concentration 2 mg/L)
IV maintenance: Continuous IV drip:
Neonate: 0.2 mg/kg/hr
6 wk-6 mo: 0.5 mg/kg/hr
6 mo-1 yr: 0.6-0.7 mg/kg/hr
1-9 yr: 1-1.2 mg/kg/hr
9-12 yr and young adult smoker: 0.9 mg/kg/hr
>12 yr healthy nonsmoker: 0.7 mg/kg/hr
The above total daily doses may also be administered IV ÷ Q4-6 hr.
Consider milligrams of theophylline available when dosing aminophylline. For oral route of administration, use theophylline.
Monitoring serum levels is essential, especially in infants and young children. Intermittent dosing for infants and children 1-5 yr may require Q4 hr dosing regimen due to enhanced metabolism/clearance. Side effects: restlessness, GI upset, headache, tachycardia, seizures (may occur in absence of other side effects with toxic levels).
Therapeutic level (as theophylline): for asthma, 10-20 mg/L; for neonatal apnea, 6-13 mg/L. Recommended guidelines for obtaining levels:
IV bolus: 30 min after infusion
IV continuous; 12-24 hr after initiation of infusion
PO liquid, immediate-release tab (theophylline product):
Peak: 1 hr post dose
Trough: just before dose
PO sustained-release (theophylline product):
Peak: 4 hr post dose
Trough: just before dose
Ideally, obtain levels after steady state has been achieved (after at least one day of therapy). Liver impairment, cardiac failure, and sustained high fever may increase theophylline levels. See Theophylline for drug interactions.
Use in breast feeding may cause irritability in infant. It is recommended to avoid breast feeding for 2 hr after IV or 4 hr after immediate-release oral intermittent dose.

Child IV for tachyarrhythmia (limited data):
5 mg/kg (max. dose: 300 mg) over 30 min followed by a continuous infusion starting at 5 micrograms (mCg)/kg/min; infusion may be increased up to a max. dose of 15 mCg/kg/min or
20 mg/kg/24 hr or 2200 mg/24 hr.
Adult PO for ventricular arrhythmias:
Loading dose: 800-1600 mg/24 hr ÷ Q12-24 hr for 1-3 wk
Maintenance: 600-800 mg/24 hr ÷ Q12-24 hr × 1 mo, then 200 mg Q12-24 hr
Use lowest effective dose to minimize adverse reactions.
Adult IV for ventricular arrhythmias:
Loading dose: 150 mg over 10 min (15 mg/min) followed by 360 mg over 6 hr (1 mg/min); followed by a maintenance dose of 0.5 mg/min. Supplemental boluses of 150 mg over 10 min may be given for breakthrough VF or hemodynamically unstable VT, and the maintenance infusion may be increased to suppress the arrhythmia. Max. dose: 2.1 g/24 hr.
Used in the resuscitation algorithm for ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia (see front cover for arrest dosing and back cover for PALS algorithm). Overall use of this drug may be limited to its potentially life-threatening side effects and the difficulties associated with managing its use.
Contraindicated in severe sinus node dysfunction, marked sinus bradycardia, second- and third- degree AV block. Use with caution in hepatic impairment.
Long elimination half-life (40-55 days). Major metabolite is active. Use of premixed injection (Nexterone) is not recommended in renal insufficiency due to accumulation of cyclodextrin excipient.
Increases cyclosporine, digoxin, phenytoin, tacrolimus, warfarin, calcium channel blockers, theophyl- line, and quinidine levels. Amiodarone is a CYP P450 3A3/4 substrate and inhibits CYP 3A3/4, 2C9, and 2D6. Risk of rhabdomyolysis is increased when used with simvastatin at doses greater than 20 mg/24 hr and lovastatin at doses greater than 40 mg/24 hr. Serious symptomatic bradycardia has been reported when used with sofosbuvir.
Proposed therapeutic level with chronic oral use: 1-2.5 mg/L.
Asymptomatic corneal microdeposits should appear in all patients. Alters liver enzymes, thyroid function. Pulmonary fibrosis reported in adults. May cause worsening of preexisting arrhythmias with bradycardia and AV block. May also cause hypotension, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, paresthesias, ataxia, tremor, SIADH, and hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Drug rash with eosino-

Correct hypokalemia, hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia whenever possible before use as these conditions may exaggerate QTc prolongation.
Intravenous continuous infusion concentration for peripheral administration should not exceed 2 mg/ mL and must be diluted with D5W. The intravenous dosage form can leach out plasticizers such as DEHP. It is recommended to reduce the potential exposure to plasticizers in pregnant women and children at the toddler stages of development and younger by using alternative methods of IV drug administration.
Oral administration should be consistent with regards to meals because food increases the rate and extent of oral absorption.





Tabs: 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150 mg
Oral syrup: 1 mg/mL
Antidepressant:
Child: Start with 1 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ TID PO for 3 days; then increase to 1.5 mg/kg/24 hr. Dose may be gradually increased to a max. dose of 5 mg/kg/24 hr if needed. Monitor ECG, BP, and heart rate (HR) for doses >3 mg/kg/24 hr.
Adolescent: 10 mg TID PO and 20 mg QHS; dose may be gradually increased up to a max. dose of 200 mg/24 hr if needed.
Adult: 40-100 mg/24 hr ÷ QHS-BID PO; dose may be gradually increased up to 300 mg/24 hr if needed; gradually decrease dose to lowest effective dose when symptoms are controlled.
Augment analgesia for chronic pain:
Child: Initial: 0.1 mg/kg/dose QHS PO; increase as needed and tolerated over 2-3 wk to 0.5-2 mg/ kg/dose QHS
Migraine prophylaxis (limited data):
Child: Initial 0.1-0.25 mg/kg/dose QHS PO; increase as needed and tolerated every 2 wk by 0.1-0.25 mg/kg/dose up to a max. dose of 2 mg/kg/24 hr or 75 mg/24 hr. For doses >1 mg/kg/24 hr, divide daily dose BID and monitor ECG.
Adult: Initial 10-25 mg/dose QHS PO; reported range of 10-400 mg/24 hr.
Contraindicated in narrow-angle glaucoma, seizures, severe cardiac disorders, and patients who received MAO inhibitors within 14 days. See Chapter 3 for management of TCA toxic ingestion.
T1/2 = 9-25 hr in adults. Maximum antidepressant effects may not occur for 2 wk or more after initiation of therapy. Do not abruptly discontinue therapy in patients receiving high doses for prolonged periods.
Therapeutic levels (sum of amitriptyline and nortriptyline): 100-250 ng/mL. Recommended serum sampling time: obtain a single level 8 hr or more after an oral dose (following 4-5 days of continuous dosing). Amitriptyline is a substrate for CYP 450 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A3/4 and inhibitor for CYP 450 1A2, 2C19, 2C9, 2D6 and 2E1. Rifampin can decrease amitriptyline levels. Amitriptyline may increase side effects of tramadol.

AMLODIPINE continued
Use with caution in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Younger children (<6 yr) may require higher mg/kg doses than older children and adults. A BID dosing regimen may provide better efficacy in children.
Reduce dose in hepatic insufficiency. Allow 5-7 days of continuous initial dose therapy before mak- ing dosage adjustments because of the drug's gradual onset of action and lengthy elimination half-life. Amlodipine is a substrate for CYP 450 3A4 and should be used with caution with 3A4 inhibitors such as protease inhibitors and azole antifungals (e.g., fluconazole and ketoconazole). May increase levels and toxicity of cyclosporine, tacrolimus and simvastatin.
Dose-related side effects include edema, dizziness, flushing, fatigue, and palpitations. Other side effects include headache, nausea, abdominal pain, and somnolence.
Limited data reports amlodipine present in breast milk at low levels, undetectable in infant plasma with no adverse effects to breastfed infants.

Renal elimination. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31). Serum levels about twice those achieved with equal dose of ampicillin. Fewer GI effects, but otherwise similar to ampicillin. Side effects: rash and diarrhea. Rash may develop with concurrent EBV infection. May increase warfarin's effect by increasing INR.
High-dose regimen is recommended in respiratory infections (e.g., CAP), acute otitis media, and sinusitis, owing to increasing incidence of penicillin resistant pneumococci. Chewable tablets may contain phenylalanine and should not be used by phenylketonurics.

See Amoxicillin for additional comments. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31). Contraindicated in patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Extended-release tablet dosage form is contraindicated in patients with CrCl <30 mL/min.
Clavulanic acid extends the activity of amoxicillin to include ß-lactamase-producing strains of
Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and some Staphylococcus aureus and may increase the risk for diarrhea.
The BID dosing schedule is associated with less diarrhea. For BID dosing, the 875 mg, 1 g tablets, the 200 mg, 400 mg chewable tablets or the 200 mg/5mL, 400 mg/5 mL, 600 mg/5 mL suspen- sions should be used. These BID dosage forms contain phenylalanine and should not be used by phenylketonurics. For TID dosing, the 250 mg, 500 mg tablets, the 125 mg 250 mg chewable tablets or the 125 mg/5 mL, 250 mg/5 mL suspensions should be used.
Higher doses of 80-90 mg/kg/24 hr (amoxicillin component) have been recommended for resistant strains of S. pneumoniae in acute otitis media and pneumonia (use BID formulations containing 7:1 or 14:1 ratio of amoxicillin to clavulanic acid or Augmentin ES-600, respectively).

6-12 yr: 5 mg QAM; increase by 5 mg/24 hr at weekly intervals until desired response. Incremental doses may be administered with the first dose at awakening and subsequent doses (5 or 10 mg) spaced at 4-6 hr intervals. Usual daily dosage range: 5-60 mg/24 hr in divided doses.
=13 yr and adult: 10 mg QAM; increase by 10 mg/24 hr at weekly intervals until desired response.
Incremental doses may be administered with the first dose at awakening and subsequent doses (5
or 10 mg) spaced at 4-6 hr intervals. Usual daily dosage range: 5-60 mg/24 hr in divided doses.
Use with caution in presence of hypertension or cardiovascular disease. Avoid use in known serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems that may increase risk of sympathomimetic effects of amphetamines (sudden death, stroke, and MI have been
reported). Contraindicated with MAO inhibitors, including linezolid and IV methylene blue, as a hypertensive crisis may occur if used within 14 days of discontinuance of MAO inhibitor. Serotonin syndrome may occur with used in combination with MAO inhibitors, SSRIs, serotonin norepineph- rine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), triptans, TCAs, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone and St. John's Wort.
Amphetamine is a minor substrate of CYP 450 2D6. Alkalinizing agents should be avoided as they can increase the effects/toxicity of amphetamine by decreasing its secretion. Avoid use of GI acid blockers (e.g., PPIs) with Adzenys ER as amphetamine dose dumping may occur.

AMPHETAMINE continued
Not recommended for patients <3 yr of age. Medication should generally not be used in children <5 yr, because diagnosis of ADHD in this age group is extremely difficult (use in consultation with a specialist). Interrupt administration occasionally to determine need for continued therapy.
Common side effects include headache, insomnia, anorexia (monitor growth), abdominal pain, anxiety, mood swings, and agitation. Psychotic disorder, peripheral vascular disease (including Raynaud phenomenon), and cerebrovascular accident have been reported.
Evekeo has an additional labeled indication for the treatment of exogenous obesity in =12 yr and
adults. Doses may be administered with or without food. Do not crush or chew the extended- release dispersible tabs (Adzenys XR-ODT). Shake oral suspension bottle (Adzenys ER and Dyanavel XR) well before dispensing and administering each dose.

Optional test dose: 0.1 mg/kg/dose IV up to max. dose of 1 mg (followed by remaining initial dose).
Initial dose: 0.5-1 mg/kg/24 hr; if test dose NOT used infuse first dose over 6 hr and monitor frequently during the first several hours.
Increment: Increase as tolerated by 0.25-0.5 mg/kg/24 hr once daily or every other day. Use larger dosage increment (0.5 mg once daily) for critically ill patients.
Usual maintenance:
Once daily dosing: 0.5-1 mg/kg/24 hr once daily
Every other day dosing: 1.5 mg/kg/dose every other day
Max. dose: 1.5 mg/kg/24 hr
Intrathecal (limited data): 25-100 mCg Q48-72 hr. Increase to 500 mCg as tolerated. Dosages as high as 1500 mCg have been recommended by the 2018 AAP Red Book.
Bladder irrigation for urinary tract mycosis (limited data): 5-15 mg in 100 mL sterile water for irriga- tion at 100-300 mL/24 hr. Instill solution into bladder, clamp catheter for 1-2 hr then drain; repeat TID-QID for 2-5 days.
Monitor renal, hepatic, electrolyte, and hematologic status closely. Hypercalciuria, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, RTA, renal failure, acute hepatic failure, hypotension, and phlebitis may occur. For dosing information in renal failure, see Chapter 31.
Common infusion-related reactions include fever, chills, headache, hypotension, nausea, and vomit- ing; may premedicate with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine 30 min before and 4 hr after infusion. Meperidine useful for chills. Hydrocortisone, 1 mg/mg ampho (max.: 25 mg) added to bottle may help to prevent immediate adverse reactions. Use total body weight for obese patients when calculating dosages.
Salt loading with 10-15 mL/kg of NS infused prior to each dose may minimize the risk of nephrotoxic- ity. Maintaining sodium intake of >4 mEq/kg/24 hr in premature neonates may also reduce risk for nephrotoxicity. Nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, chemotherapeutic agents, and cyclo- sporine may result in synergistic toxicity. Hypokalemia may increase the toxicity of neuromuscular blocking agents and cardiac glycosides.
Although there is no breast-feeding data for amphotericin, many experts believe it is compatible since the drug is highly protein bound, has a large molecular weight and is not absorbed orally.



Injection: 5 mg/mL (20 mL)
(formulated as a 1:1 molar ratio of amphotericin B to lipid complex comprised of dimyristoylphosphati- dylcholine and dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol)

SBE prophylaxis:
Moderate risk patients:
Child: 50 mg/kg/dose (max. dose: 2 g/dose) × 1 IV/IM 30 min before procedure
Adult: 2 g/dose × 1 IV/IM 30 min before procedure
High risk patients with GU and GI procedures: Aforementioned doses PLUS gentamicin 1.5 mg/kg × 1 (max. dose: 120 mg) IV within 30 min of starting procedure. Followed by ampicillin 25 mg/kg/ dose IV (or PO amoxicillin) × 1, 6 hr later.
Use higher doses with shorter dosing intervals to treat CNS disease and severe infection. CSF penetration occurs only with inflamed meninges. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).
Produces the same side effects as penicillin, with cross-reactivity. Rash commonly seen at 5-10 days and rash may occur with concurrent EBV infection or allopurinol use. May cause interstitial nephritis, diarrhea, and pseudomembranous enterocolitis. Chloroquine reduces ampicillin's oral absorption.

Injection:
1.5 g = ampicillin 1 g + sulbactam 0.5 g 3 g = ampicillin 2 g + sulbactam 1 g
 15 g = ampicillin 10 g + sulbactam 5 g Contains 5 mEq Na per 1.5 g drug combination
Dosage based on ampicillin component:
Neonate:
Premature (based on pharmacokinetic data): 100 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q12 hr IM/IV
Full term: 100 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q8 hr IM/IV
Infant =1 mo and child (see remarks):
Mild/moderate infections: 100-200 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q6 hr IM/IV; max. dose: 2 g ampicillin/dose
Meningitis/severe infections: 200-400 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q4-6 hr IM/IV; max. dose: 2 g ampicillin/dose
Adult: 1-2 g Q6-8 hr IM/IV
Max. dose: 8 g ampicillin/24 hr
Similar spectrum of antibacterial activity to ampicillin with the added coverage of ß-lactamase producing organisms. Total sulbactam dose should not exceed 4 g/24 hr.
Use higher doses with shorter dosing intervals to treat CNS disease and severe infection. Hepatic dysfunction, including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice, has been reported. Monitor hepatic func- tion in patients with hepatic impairment.
Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31). Similar CSF distribution and side effects to ampicillin. Postmarking adverse reactions reported include abdominal pain, melena, gastritis, stomatitis, dyspepsia, black hairy tongue, dizziness, dyspnea, TEN, and urticaria.

Injection: 10% (100 mg/mL) arginine hydrochloride, contains 47.5 mEq chloride per 100 mL (300 mL)
Osmolality: 950 mOsmol/L
Used as a secondary alternative agent for patients that are unresponsive or unable to receive sodium chloride and potassium chloride.
Correction of hypochloremia: Arginine chloride dose in milliequivalents (mEq) = 0.2 × patient's weight (kg)
× (103 - patient's serum chloride in mEq/L). Administer 1/2 to 2/3 of the calculated dose and reassess.
Drug administration: Do not exceed an IV infusion rate of 1 g/kg/hr (4.75 mEq/kg/hr). Drug may be administered without further dilution but should be diluted to reduce risk of tissue irritation.
Hyperammonemia in metabolic disorders: See Chapter 13
Contraindicated in renal or hepatic failure. Use with extreme caution as overdosages may result in hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, cerebral edema, and death. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, and hematuria have been reported.
Arginine hydrochloride is metabolized to nitrogen-containing products for renal excretion. Excess arginine increases the production of nitric oxide (NO) to cause vasodilation/hypotension. Closely monitor acid/base status. Hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, GI disturbances, IV extravasation, headache, and flushing may occur.
In addition to its use for chloride supplementation, arginine is used in urea cycle disorder therapy (increase arginine levels and prevent breakdown of endogenous proteins) and as a diagnostic agent for growth hormone (stimulates pituitary release of growth hormone).

10 mg PO once daily. If necessary after 7 days, dose may be increased in 5 mg increments of =7
days in duration up to a maximum of 20 mg/24 hr.
Monitor for clinical worsening of depression and suicidal ideation/behavior after initiation of therapy or after dose changes. Avoid use of extended-release IM injection with CYP 450 inducers, including carbamazepine, for >14 days. Higher cumulative doses and longer treatment duration may increase risk for irreversible tardive dyskinesia.
Weight gain, constipation, GI discomfort, akathisia, dizziness, extrapyramidal symptoms, headaches, insomnia, sedation, blurred vision, and fatigue are common. May cause leukopenia, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, hiccups, hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, hypergly- cemia, orthostatic hypotension (risk for falls), and prolongation of the QT interval (use considered contraindicated with other medications prolonging the QT interval). Rare impulse-control problems such as compulsive or uncontrollable urges to gamble, binge eat, shop, and have sex has been reported.
Primarily metabolized by the CYP 450 2D6 and 3A4 enzymes. Dosage reduction for using half of the usual dose has been recommended for those who are either known CYP 450 2D6 poor metabolizers; or nonpoor CYP 450 2D6 metabolizers taking strong CYP 450 2D6 (e.g., quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine) or 3A4 (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin) inhibitors. Use of 1/4 the usual dose has been recommended for known CYP 2D6 poor metabolizers taking either a strong 2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor; or nonpoor CYP 450 2D6 metabolizers taking both strong 2D6 AND 3A4 inhibitors.
Consult with a pediatric psychiatrist for use in ADHD, conduct disorder, and PDD-NOS. Oral doses may be administered with or without meals. Do not split orally disintegrating tablet dosage form.

ASPIRIN continued
Do not use in children <16 yr for treatment of varicella or flulike symptoms (risk for Reye syndrome), in combination with other NSAIDs, or in severe renal failure. Use with caution in bleeding disorders, renal dysfunction, gastritis, and gout. May cause GI upset, allergic reactions, liver toxicity, and decreased platelet aggregation.
Drug interactions: may increase effects of methotrexate, valproic acid, and warfarin which may lead to toxicity (protein displacement). Buffered dosage forms may decrease absorption of ketoconazole and tetracycline. GI bleeds have been reported with concurrent use of SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline).
A moderate initial febrile phase dosage of 30-50 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ QID for Kawasaki disease is used in Japan and Western Europe because there are no data to suggest this or the higher dosage regimen is superior.
Therapeutic levels: antipyretic/analgesic: 30-50 mg/L, antiinflammatory: 150-300 mg/L. Tinnitus may occur at levels of 200-400 mg/L. Recommended serum sampling time at steady state: obtain trough level just prior to dose following 1-2 days of continuous dosing. Peak levels obtained 2 hr (for nonsustained release dosage forms) after a dose may be useful for monitoring toxicity. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).
For breast-feeding considerations:
High-dose aspirin regimens: use an alternative drug is recommended.
Low-dose (75-162 mg/24 hr) aspirin regimens: avoid breastfeeding for 1-2 hr after a dose.

Adult: 25-100 mg/dose PO once daily; max. dose: 100 mg/24 hr
Contraindicated in pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock. May cause bradycardia, hypotension, second- or third-degree AV block, dizziness, fatigue, lethargy, and headache. Use with caution in diabetes and asthma. Wheezing and dyspnea have occurred when daily dosage exceeds 100 mg/24 hr. Postmarketing evaluation reports a temporal relationship for
causing elevated LFTs and/or bilirubin, hallucinations, psoriatic rash, thrombocytopenia, visual disturbances, and dry mouth. Avoid abrupt withdrawal of the drug. Does not cross the blood-brain barrier; lower incidence of CNS side effects compared with propranolol. Neonates born to mothers receiving atenolol during labor or while breastfeeding may be at risk for hypoglycemia.
Use with disopyramide, amiodarone or digoxin may enhance bradycardic effects. Adjust dose in renal impairment (see Chapter 31).

Start with 0.5 mg/kg/24 hr PO QAM and increase after a minimum of 3 days to approximately
1.2 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ QAM or BID (morning and late afternoon/early evening).
Max. daily dose: 1.4 mg/kg/24 hr or 100 mg, whichever is less.
If used with a strong CYP 450 2D6 inhibitor (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine) or in patients with reduced CYP 450 2D6 activity: Maintain aforementioned initial dose for 4 wk and increase to a max. of 1.2 mg/kg/24 hr only if symptoms do not improve and initial dose is tolerated.
Child =6 yr and adolescent >70 kg (see remarks):
Start with 40 mg PO QAM and increase after a minimum of 3 days to approximately 80 mg/24 hr PO
÷ QAM or BID (morning and late afternoon/early evening). After 2-4 wk, dose may be increased to a max. of 100 mg/24 hr if needed.
If used with a strong CYP 450 2D6 inhibitor (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine) or in patients with reduced CYP 450 2D6 activity: Maintain aforementioned initial dose for 4 wk and increase to 80 mg/24 hr only if symptoms do not improve and initial dose is tolerated.
Contraindicated in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, pheochromocytoma, and severe cardiac disorders. Do not administer with or within 2 wk after discontinuing an MAO inhibitor; fatal reactions have been reported. Use with caution in hypertension, tachycardia, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases, or with concurrent albuterol therapy. Increased risk of suicidal thinking has been reported; closely monitor for clinical worsening, agitation, aggressive behavior, irritability, suicidal thinking or behaviors, and unusual changes in behavior when initiating (first few months) or at times of dose changes (increases or decreases). Atomoxetine is a CYP 450 2D6 substrate; poor 2D6 metabolizers compared with normal has been reported to have higher rates of adverse effects (insomnia, weight loss, constipation, depression, tremor, and excoriation), greater improvement of ADHD symptoms with lower final dose requirements. Alopecia and hyperhidrosis have been reported.
Doses >1.2 mg/kg/24 hr in patients =70 kg have not been shown to be of additional benefit. Reduce
dose (initial and target doses) by 50% and 75% for patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) and severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic insufficiency, respectively.
Major side effects include GI discomfort, vomiting, fatigue, anorexia, dizziness, and mood swings. Hypersensitivity reactions, aggression, irritability, priapism, allergic reactions, and severe liver injury have also been reported. Consider interrupting therapy in patients who are not growing or gaining weight satisfactorily.
Doses may be administered with or without food. Atomoxetine can be discontinued without tapering.

Contraindicated in glaucoma, obstructive uropathy, tachycardia, and thyrotoxicosis, except for severe or life-threatening muscarinic symptoms. Use with caution in patients sensitive to sulfites.
Use in neonatal bradycardia is no longer recommended. Data suggest the use of a minimum 0.1-mg dose may not be warranted for the preintubation indication. Use of the minimum 0.1-mg dose could result in an overdose in younger patients.
Side effects include: dry mouth, blurred vision, fever, tachycardia, constipation, urinary retention, CNS signs (dizziness, hallucinations, restlessness, fatigue, headache).
In case of bradycardia, may give via endotracheal tube at 0.04-0.06 mg/kg (dilute with NS to volume of 1-2 mL and follow each dose with 1 mL NS). Use injectable solution for nebulized use; can
be mixed with albuterol for simultaneous administration. AtroPen dosage form is designed of IM administration to the outer thigh.
Ophthalmic use is not recommended for children less than 3 mo of age due to risk for systemic absorption.

Increased risk for hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma has been reported in adolescents and young adults. Toxicity: bone marrow suppression, rash, stomatitis, hepatotoxicity, alopecia, arthralgias, and GI disturbances.
Use 1/4-1/3 dose when given with xanthine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., allopurinol). Patients with low or absent thiopurine methyl transferase (TPMT) or nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) may be at increased risk for severe and life-threatening myelotoxicity. Consider alternative therapy in
patients with homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency and reduced dosages in patients with het- erozygous deficiency. Individuals with the low functioning alleles for NUDT15 are common among Asian ancestry and Hispanic ethnicity.
Severe anemia has been reported when used in combination with captopril or enalapril. Monitor CBC, platelets, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, BUN, and creatinine. Pancytopenia and bone
marrow suppression have been reported with concomitant use of pegylated interferon and ribavirin in patients with hepatitis C. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has been reported. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).
Administer oral doses with food to minimize GI discomfort. To minimize infant exposure via breast- milk, avoid breastfeeding for 4-6 hr after administering a maternal dose.

No longer recommended for otitis media due to increased resistant pathogens.
Contraindicated in hypersensitivity to macrolides and history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic
dysfunction associated with prior use. Use with caution in impaired hepatic function, GFR <10 mL/min (limited data), hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, bradycardia, arrhythmias, prolonged QT intervals, and receiving medications that can cause the aforementioned conditions of caution. May cause increase in hepatic enzymes, cholestatic jaundice, GI discomfort, and pain at injection site (IV use). Compared with other macrolides, less risk for drug interactions. Nelfinavir may increase azithromycin levels; monitor for liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment. Vomiting, diarrhea, and nausea have been reported at higher frequency in otitis media with 1-day dosing regimen. Exacerbations of myasthenia gravis/ syndrome, serious skin reactions (e.g., SJS and TEN), infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, decreased lymphocytes, and elevated bilirubin, BUN, and creatinine have been reported. CNS penetration is poor.
Aluminum- and magnesium-containing antacids decrease absorption. Tablet and oral suspension dosage forms may be administered with or without food. Extended-release oral suspension should be taken on an empty stomach (at least 1 hr before or 2 hr following a meal). Intravenous adminis- tration is over 1-3 hr; do not give as a bolus or IM injection.
Ophthalmic Use: Do not wear contact lenses. Eye irritation is the most common side effect.

Intrathecal continuous infusion maintenance therapy (not well established):
<12 yr: average dose of 274 mCg/24 hr (range: 24-1199 mCg/24 hr) has been reported.
=12 yr and adult: most required 300-800 mCg/24 hr (range: 12-2003 mCg/24 hr with limited experience at doses >1000 mCg/24 hr)
Avoid abrupt withdrawal of drug. Use with caution in patients with seizure disorder or impaired renal function. Approximately 70%-80% of the drug is excreted in the urine unchanged. Administer oral doses with food or milk.
Adverse effects: Drowsiness, fatigue, nausea, vertigo, psychiatric disturbances, rash, urinary frequency, and hypotonia. Avoid abrupt withdrawal of intrathecal therapy to prevent potential life- threatening events (rhabdomyolysis, multiple organ-system failure, and death).
Cases of intrathecal mass at the tip of the implanted catheter leading to withdrawal symptoms have been reported. Inadvertent subcutaneous injection may occur with improper access of the reservoir refill septum and may result in an overdose. Sterile techniques must be used with intrathecal use accounting for all nonsterile external surfaces.
Usual maintenance oral dosage range observed from a collection of smaller prospective and retro- spective studies suggest following (see dosage section for initial dose titration):
<2 yr: 10-20 mg/24 hr ÷ Q8 hr to a maximum of 40 mg/24 hr
2-7 yr: 20-40 mg/24 hr ÷ Q8 hr to a maximum of 60 mg/24 hr

Recent pediatric phase 3 comparison trial with oseltamivir (MINISONE-2) showed comparable efficacy and baloxavir was well tolerated. Influenza prophylaxis use and human pregnancy information are currently not available.
Adverse effects reported in clinical trials include diarrhea, bronchitis, nasopharyngitis, headache, and nausea.
Baloxavir marboxil is a prodrug that is rapidly converted to the active baloxavir following oral admin- istration. No clinically meaningful pharmacokinetics differences with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) or with creatinine clearances =50 mL/min. Pharmacokinetics have not been
evaluated in severe hepatic and/or severe renal impairment.
Primarily metabolized by UGT1A3 with minor contribution from CYP3A4. May reduce the efficacy of intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine.
Dose may be administered with or without food. Avoid coadministration with dairy products, calcium, aluminum, magnesium, multivitamins with minerals, iron, selenium, or zinc, because decreased absorption of baloxavir may occur.

Not recommended for children <4 yr with oral inhalation and <6 yr (Becnase AQ) or <4 yr (Qnasl Children's) with the nasal administration because of unknown safety and efficacy. Dose should be titrated to lowest effective dose. Avoid using higher than recommended doses.
Avoid use of nasal dosage form in recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery or nasal trauma. Nasal septal perforation has been reported with nasal product. Psychiatric and behavioral changes have been reported in children with the oral inhalation product. Routinely monitor growth of pediatric patients with chronic use of all dosage form.
When converting from fluticasone to beclomethasone for oral inhalation use, consider the following:

Fluticasone MDI (Flovent HFA)Fluticasone DPI (Flovent Diskus)Beclomethasone BAI (QVAR Redihaler)44 mCg: 2 puffs BID50 mCg: 2 inhalations BID40 mCg: 1 puff BID110 mCg: 2 puffs BID100 mCg: 2 inhalations BID40 mCg: 2 puffs BID220 mCg: 2 puffs BID250 mCg: 2 inhalations BID80 mCg: 2 puffs BIDBAI, Breath-activated inhaler; DPI, dry powder inhaler; MDI, metered dose inhaler.

CYP 450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin, and protease inhibitors) or significant hepatic impairment may increase systemic exposure of beclomethasone.
Monitor for hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal, or growth suppression, and hypercorticism. Rinse mouth and gargle with water after oral inhalation; may cause thrush.
QVAR Redihaler is a breath-activated inhaler device and requires the patient to have a minimum inspi- ratory flow rate of 30 L/min for proper dose activation and does not require priming. Do not shake the Redihaler device with the cap open, and do not use it with a tube spacer or volume holding chamber.

Use with caution in hypothyroidism, cirrhosis, ulcerative colitis, and history of allergic reactions to corticosteroids. See Chapter 8 for relative steroid potencies and doses based on body surface area. Betamethasone is inadequate when used alone for adrenocortical insufficiency because its minimal mineralocorticoid properties. Like all steroids, may cause hypertension, pseudotumor cerebri, acne, Cushing syndrome, adrenal axis suppression, GI bleeding, hyperglycemia, and osteoporosis.
Betamethasone is a substrate for CYP 450 3A4, and use with a strong inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole and itraconazole) may lead to increased exposure and side effects of betamethasone.
Na phosphate and acetate injectable suspension recommended for IM, intra-articular, intrasynovial intralesional, soft tissue use only; but not for IV use. Topical betamethasone dipropionate aug- mented (Diprolene and Diprolene AF) is not recommended in children =12 yr owing to the higher risk for adrenal suppression.
Injectable IM dosage form is used in premature labor to stimulate fetal lung maturation.

BOSENTAN continued
Contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant and with concurrent use of cyclosporine (increases bosentan concentrations) or glyburide (increases risk for
hepatotoxicity). Due to these risks, bosentan is available only through the Tracleer REMS program where prescribers and pharmacies need to be certified. See www.tracleerrems.com or call
1-866-228-3546 for more information.
Baseline and monthly monitoring of serum aminotransferases and bilirubin; and pregnancy tests for females of reproductive potential (two forms of birth control required) are required. Use should be avoided in patients with preexisting hepatic impairment (baseline aminotransferases >3 times the usual normal limit).
May cause respiratory tract infections, anemia (dose related), edema, increased liver amino- transferases (see dosage modification; higher incidence in adults) and pyrexia. Decreased sperm counts, liver cirrhosis, liver failure, DRESS, thrombocytopenia, and sinusitis have been reported.
Bosentan is substrate for the CYP2C9 and 3A4 enzymes, and OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 transporter. It also induces CYP2C9 and 3A4; may decrease sildenafil levels. Reduces the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.
Doses may be administered orally with or without food.

BUDESONIDE continued
Nasal inhalation:
=6 to <12 yr: Start at 1 spray in each nostril once daily. If needed, increase to 2 sprays each nostril once daily. Then reduce dose back to initial dose when symptoms improve. Max. nasal dose:
128 mCg/24 hr (4 sprays/24 hr).
=12 yr to adult: Start at 2 sprays in each nostril once daily. When symptoms improve, reduce dose to 1 spray each nostril once daily. Usual max. dose is 128 mCg/24 hr (4 sprays/24 hr) but some
may require 256 mCg/24 hr (8 sprays/24 hr) initially with a subsequent reduced dosage to improve symptoms.
Crohn disease (Encort EC and generics):
Child =6 yr (see remarks): Data are limited; only the following dosages have been reported. Additional studies are needed.
Active disease: 9 mg PO once daily × 7-8 wk
Maintenance of remission: 6 mg PO once daily × 3-4 wk
In addition, a report in 10-19 yr old children demonstrated higher remission rates with an induc- tion dose of 12 mg PO once daily × 4 wk, followed by 9 mg PO once daily × 3 wk, followed by
6 mg PO once daily × 3 wk.
Adult:
Active disease: 9 mg PO QAM × 8 wk; if remission is not achieved, a second 8-wk course may be given.
Maintenance of remission: 6 mg PO once daily for up to 3 mo. If symptom control is maintained at 3 mo, taper dosage to compete cessation. Remission therapy beyond 3 mo has not shown to provide substantial clinical benefit.
Ulcerative colitis, induction of remission (Uceris and generics):
Adult:
Extended release oral tablet: 9 mg PO QAM for up to 8 wk
Rectal foam: 2 mg PR BID × 2 wk followed by 2 mg PR once daily × 4 wk
Reduce maintenance dose to as low as possible to control symptoms. May cause pharyngitis, cough, epistaxis, nasal irritation, and HPA-axis suppression. Rinse mouth after each use
via the oral inhalation route. Nebulized budesonide has been shown effective in mild to moderate croup at doses of 2 mg × 1. Ref: N Engl J Med 331(5):285.
Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with the inhaled route. Anaphylactic reactions, rectal bleeding, peripheral edema, mood swings, increased blood pressure, rash, and benign intracranial hypertension have been reported with oral route of administration.
Safety and effectiveness for mild/moderate Crohn disease have been established for children
8-17 yr old weighing =25 kg. Safety and efficacy have NOT been established in pediatric patients for the maintenance of clinical remission of mild/moderate Crohn disease. Although the reported safety profile in pediatric Crohn disease is consistent with adults, there may be increased risk for decreased growth velocity due to higher systemic absorption of corticosteroids in children with Crohn disease.
CYP 450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin, protease inhibitors) or significant hepatic impairment may increase systemic exposure of budesonide (inhalation and PO routes).
Onset of action for oral inhalation and nebulized suspension is within 1 day and 2-8 days, respec- tively, with peak effects at 1-2 wk and 4-6 wk, respectively.

B
For nasal use, onset of action is seen after 1 day with peak effects after 3-7 days of ther
apy. Discontinue therapy if no improvement in nasal symptoms after 3 wk of continuous therapy.
Pulmicort Flexhaler is a breath activated device which requires the patient to have an inspiratory flow rate of approximately 60 L/min for optimal drug delivery.
Pregnancy category is "B" for inhalation routes of administration and "C" for the oral and rectal routes. Breast feeding category is "2" for inhalation routes and "?" for the rectal route.
Breast feeding with the oral route of administration may result in budesonide exposure to the infant up to 10 times higher than that by the inhalation route. Do not crush or chew the oral capsule dosage form.





Aerosol inhaler:

5-11 yr (NIH Asthma Guideline 2007 recommendations) and 6 to <12 yr (FDA labeling); see remarks: Two inhalations BID of 80 mCg budesonide + 4.5 mCg formoterol; max. dose: 4 inhalations/24 hr.
=12 yr and adult:
No prior inhaled steroid use: Start with two inhalations BID of 80 mCg budesonide + 4.5 mCg
formoterol OR 160 mCg budesonide + 4.5 mCg formoterol, depending on severity.
Prior low to medium doses of inhaled steroid use: Start with two inhalations BID of 80 mCg budesonide + 4.5 mCg formoterol.
Prior medium to high doses of inhaled steroid use: Start with two inhalations BID of 160 mCg budesonide + 4.5 mCg formoterol.
Max. dose: 2 inhalations of 160 mCg budesonide + 4.5 mCg formoterol BID
See Budesonide and Formoterol for remarks. Should only be used for patients not adequately controlled on other asthma-controller medications (e.g., low-to-medium dose inhaled corticosteroids) or whose disease severity requires the use of two maintenance therapies. Titrate to the lowest effective strength after asthma is adequately controlled.
Reported side effects at =3% and more frequently compared with budesonide alone include URI,
pharyngitis, headache, and rhinitis.
As needed rescue therapy with budesonide/formoterol was found to be noninferior to maintenance budesonide and PRN terbutaline for controlling symptoms in mild asthmatics =12 yr old (Ref. N Engl J Med 378[20]:1877).
Proper patient education including dosage administration technique is essential; see patient package insert for detailed instructions. Rinse mouth after each use.

Alternatively, the patient may receive 2 mg initially (1 mg in each nostril) only if they remain recumbent if drowsiness or dizzi- ness occurs; an additional dose may be given 3-4 hr later.
A synthetic mixed agonist/antagonist opioid analgesic. Contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to benzethonium chloride. Use with caution in hypotension, thyroid
dysfunction, renal or hepatic impairment, and concomitant CNS depressants. Suggested dosage reduction in renal impairment (IV/IM): 75% of usual dose for GFR 10-50 mL/min and 50% of usual dose for GFR <10 mL/min with an increase in dosage interval based on duration of clinical effects. A 50% IV/IM dosage reduction with increased dosage interval has been recommended
in hepatic dysfunction. Reduced dosage for intranasal administration for both renal and hepatic impairment: initial dose should not exceed 1 mg.
Butorphanol is a P450 3A4 substrate. Cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may increase butophanol's effects and toxicity (fatal respiratory depression).

Continued


CALCITONIN-SALMON continued
Contraindicated in patients sensitive to salmon protein or gelatin. Because of hypersensitivity risk (e.g., bronchospasm, airway swelling, anaphylaxis), skin test is recommended before initiating IM/SC therapy. For skin test, prepare a 10-U/mL dilution with normal saline (NS), administer
0.1 mL intradermally, and observe for 15 min for wheal or significant erythema. Tachyphylaxis has been reported after 2-3 days of use for the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy.

Common side effects include somnolence, decreased appetite, diarrhea, elevated transaminase (dose related), fatigue, malaise and asthenia, rash, insomnia, and sleep disorder. Suicidal behavior and ideation and respiratory failure have been reported.
Monitor ALT, AST, and total bilirubin at baseline and 1, 3, 6 mo initially and periodically thereafter. More frequent monitoring is recommended with concurrent valproic acid or clobazam. Reduce dose or discontinue use in the presence of hepatic impairment.
Epidiolex is a substrate for CYP 450 2C19 and 3A4; other moderate/strong inducers or inhibitors for these enzymes may affect its overall exposure. May increase the effects/toxicity of clobazam and diazepam because it may inhibit CYP 450 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, and 2C19. May inhibit the UGT 1A9 and 2B7 transporters.
Teratogen data limited only to animal studies with evidence of developmental toxicities at similar exposure concentrations in humans receiving therapeutic doses. Patients exposed to cannabidiol during pregnancy are encouraged to register with the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry at www.aedpregnancyregistry.org.
Administration with high-fat or high-calorie meals may increase absorption. Gradually taper when discontinuing medication; avoid abrupt discontinuation.

Adolescent and adult: Initially, 12.5-25 mg/dose PO BID-TID; increase weekly if necessary by 25 mg/ dose to max. dose: 450 mg/24 hr. Usual dosage range: 25-100 mg/24 hr ÷ BID.
Onset within 15-30 min of administration. Peak effect within 1-2 hr. Adjust dose with renal failure (see Chapter 31). Should be administered on an empty stomach 1 hr before or 2 hr after meals. Titrate to minimal effective dose. Lower doses should be used in patients with sodium and water depletion because of diuretic therapy.
Use with caution in collagen vascular disease and concomitant potassium sparing diuretics. Avoid use with dialysis with high-flux membranes as anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. May cause rash, proteinuria, neutropenia, cough, angioedema (head, neck and intestine), hyperkalemia, hypotension, or diminution of taste perception (with long term use). Known to decrease aldosterone and increase renin production. Do not coadminister with angiotensin receptor blockers or aliskiren as use has been associated with increased risks for hypotension, hyperkalemia, and acute renal failure. Captopril is a CYP 450 2D6 substrate. Use with sirolimus, everolimus, temsirolimus, or sacubitril may increase risk for angioedema.
Captopril should be discontinued as soon as possible when pregnancy is detected.

CARBAMAZEPINE continued
Intravenous dosage form (Carnexiv; see remarks) cont.:
Adult (IV; indicated as replacement therapy for PO carbamazepine when PO route is not feasible): Determine IV daily dose by taking 70% of the established total daily oral dosage and dividing into 4 equal doses to be administered Q6 hr. Each dose is further diluted in 100 mL of compatible fluid and infused over 30 min. Use is NOT recommended >7 days.
Contraindicated for patients taking monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or who are sensitive to tricyclic antidepressants. Should not be used in combination with clozapine, owing to increased risk for bone marrow suppression and agranulocytosis. Increased risk for severe dermatologic reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome [SJS] and toxic epidermal necrolysis [TEN]) has been associated with the HLA-B*1502 (prevalent among Asian descent) and HLA-A*3101 (prevalent among Japanese, Native American, Southern Indian, and some Arabic ancestry) alleles.
Erythromycin, diltiazem, verapamil, cefixime, cimetidine, itraconazole, aprepitant, and INH may increase serum levels. Carbamazepine may decrease activity of warfarin, direct-acting oral anticoagulants (e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban), doxycycline, oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, theophylline, phenytoin, benzodiazepines, ethosuximide, and valproic acid. Carbamazepine is a CYP 450 3A3/4 substrate and inducer of CYP 450 1A2, 2C, and 3A3/4. The enzyme-inducing effects may increase effects/toxicity of cyclophosphamide. CYP 450 3A4 inhibitors may increase carbamazepine levels/toxicity.
Suggested dosing intervals for specific dosage forms: extended-release tabs or caps (BID); chewable and immediate-release tablets (BID-TID); suspension (QID).
Doses may be administered with food. Do not crush or chew extended-release dosage forms. Shake bottle well prior to dispensing oral suspension dosage form, and do not administer simultaneously with other liquid medicines or diluents.
Drug metabolism typically increases after the first month of therapy initiation due to hepatic autoinduction.
Therapeutic blood levels for seizures: 4-12 mg/L. Recommended serum sampling time: obtain trough level within 30 min prior to an oral dose. Steady state is typically achieved 1 mo following the initia- tion of therapy (following enzymatic autoinduction). Levels obtained prior to steady state are useful for preventing toxicity. Blood trough levels of 7-10 mg/L have been recommended for bipolar disorders.
Side effects include sedation, dizziness, diplopia, aplastic anemia, neutropenia, urinary retention, nausea, SIADH, and SJS. Suicidal behavior or ideation, hypogammaglobulinemia, and onychomade- sis have been reported. Approximately one-third of patients who had hypersensitivity reactions will also experience the hypersensitivity to oxcarbazepine. Pretreatment complete blood counts (CBCs) and liver function tests (LFTs) are suggested. Patient should be monitored for hematologic and hepatic toxicity. Most common side effects with the IV route, dizziness, somnolence, blurred vision, diplopia, headache, infusion-related reaction, infusion site pain, and anemia.
Adjust dose in renal impairment (see Chapter 31). Do not use IV dosage form in moderate/severe renal impairment (GFR <30 mL/min) due to accumulation of betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium, which may be nephrotoxic.

Immediate-release dosage forms: Start at 6.25 mg PO BID; dose may be doubled every 1-2 wk up to a maximum of 25 mg PO BID.
Extended-release capsules: Start at 20 mg PO once daily × 1-2 wk, if needed and tolerated, increase to 40 mg PO once daily. If needed, dose may be further increased in 2-wk intervals up to a maximum of 80 mg/24 hr.
Immediate-release and extended-release products are NOT interchangeable on a mg-to-mg basis. Contraindicated in asthma or related bronchospastic disease, sick sinus syndrome, 2nd- or 3rd-degree heart block, severe bradycardia, cardiogenic shock, decompensated cardiac failure requiring IV inotropic therapy, and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C).
Use with caution mild/moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A or B), renal insufficiency, thyrotoxico- sis, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, and cataract surgery. Avoid abrupt withdrawal of medication. Children <3.5 yr old may have faster carvedilol clearance and may require higher dosages or TID dos-
ing. Carvedilol is a CYP 450 2D6 substrate. Digoxin, disopyramide, and dipyridamole may increase bradycardic effects.
Bradycardia, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, weight gain, hyperglycemia, diarrhea, dizziness, and fatigue are common. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Chest pain, headache, vomiting, edema, and dyspnea have also been reported in children. Administering doses with food can reduce risk for orthostatic hypotension.


Injection: 50, 70 mg; contains sucrose (39 mg in 50 mg vial and 54 mg in 70 mg vial) and mannitol (26 mg in 50 mg vial and 36 mg in 70 mg vial)
Preterm neonate to <3 mo infant:
BSA dosing (based on a small pharmacokinetic study, achieving similar plasma exposure as seen in adults receiving 50 mg/24 hr): 25 mg/m2/dose IV once daily.
Weight-based dosing (based on a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled, and case series data): 2 mg/kg/dose IV once daily for at least 2 wk after first negative blood culture and resolution of signs/symptoms for invasive candidiasis have been reported to be more efficacious with fewer side effects than conventional amphotericin B.
3 mo infant-17 yr (see remarks): 70 mg/m2/dose IV loading dose on day 1 followed by 50 mg/m2/dose IV once daily maintenance dose. Increase the maintenance dose to 70 mg/m2/dose if response is inadequate or if the patient is receiving an enzyme-inducing medication (see remarks).
Maximum loading and maintenance dose: 70 mg/dose.
Adult (see remarks):
Loading dose: 70 mg IV × 1
Maintenance dose:
Usual: 50 mg IV once daily. If tolerated and response is inadequate or if patient is receiving an enzyme-inducing medication (see remarks), increase to 70 mg IV once daily.
Hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh score 7-9): 35 mg IV once daily.
Use with caution in hepatic impairment and concomitant enzyme-inducing drugs. Higher maintenance doses (70 mg/m2/dose in children and 70 mg in adults) are recommended for concomitant use of enzyme inducers such as carbamazepine, dexamethasone, phenytoin, nevirapine, efavirenz, or rifampin. Use Mosteller formula for calculating body surface area (BSA).

Bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis for dental and upper respiratory procedures: Infant and child: 50 mg/kg IV/IM (max. dose: 1 g) 30 min before procedure Adult: 1 g IV/IM 30 min before procedure
Contraindicated in neonates with hyperbilirubinemia. Do not administer with IV calcium- containing solutions or products (mixed or administered simultaneously via different lines) in neonates (<28 days old) because of risk of precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium salt.
Cases of fatal reactions with calcium-ceftriaxone precipitates in lung and kidneys in preterm and full-term neonates have been reported. Do not administer simultaneously with IV calcium-containing solutions via a Y-site for any age group. IV calcium-containing products may be administered sequentially only when the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid.
Use with caution in penicillin allergy; patients with gallbladder, biliary tract, liver, or pancreatic disease; presence of renal impairment; or in neonates with continuous dosing (risk for hyperbilirubinemia). In neonates, consider using an alternative third-generation cephalosporin with similar activity. Unlike other cephalosporins, ceftriaxone is significantly cleared by the biliary route (35%-45%).
Rash, injection site pain, diarrhea, and transient increase in liver enzymes are common. May cause reversible cholelithiasis, sludging in gallbladder, and jaundice. May interfere with serum and urine creatinine assays (Jaffe method) and cause false-positive urinary protein and urinary reducing substances (Clinitest).
For IM injections, dilute drug with either sterile water for injection or 1% lidocaine to a concentra- tion of 250 or 350 mg/mL (250 mg/mL has lower incidence of injection site reactions). Assess the potential risk/benefit for using lidocaine as a diluent; see Lidocaine for additional remarks especially risk for methemoglobinemia.

Use with caution in penicillin-allergic patients or in presence of renal impairment. May cause GI discomfort; thrombophlebitis at the infusion site; false-positive urine-reducing substance (Clinitest and other copper reduction method tests) and Coombs test; and may interfere with serum and urine creatinine determinations by the alkaline picrate method. Transient increases in liver enzymes have been reported. Not recommended for meningitis.
Oral suspension dosage form currently not available. Tablets and oral suspension are NOT bioequiva- lent and CANNOT be substituted on a mg/mg basis. Concurrent use of antacids, H2 blockers, and proton pump inhibitors may decrease oral absorption. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).

Adult (see remarks): 100-200 mg PO BID
Contraindicated for perioperative pain with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Use with caution in patients with systemic-onset JRA due to risk for serious adverse reactions (e.g., disseminated intravascular coagulation). In adults, serious cardiovascular and GI risks reported include thrombosis, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, GI bleed, GI ulceration, and GI perforation. Common adverse effects include headache, diarrhea, nausea, and hypertension. TEN, SJS, acute kidney injury, and hyperkalemia have also been reported.
Celecoxib is a substrate of CYP 450 2C9. Poor metabolizers of 2C9 should start with half the lowest recommended dose and use with caution, or consider alternative therapy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, loop diuretics, and sodium phosphates may increase risk for renal dysfunction. Oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), anticoagulants, SSRIs, smoking, alcohol use, older age, and poor health status may increase risk for GI bleeds with prolonged treat- ment courses. Celecoxib may reduce the antihypertensive effects of ACE inhibitors and increase the levels/toxicity of lithium, metoprolol, and methotrexate.
Not recommended for use in severe renal dysfunction and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). Reduce dose by 50% and monitor patient closely in moderate hepatic impairment (Child- Pugh Class B).
Pregnancy category is "C" for prior to 30 wk's gestation and "D" for 30 wk and greater.

Max. dose (all ages): 4 g/24 hr
Dose recommendations are just guidelines for therapy; monitoring of blood levels is essential. Follow hematologic status for dose-related or idiosyncratic marrow suppression. "Gray baby" syndrome may be seen with levels >50 mg/L. Use with caution in G6PD deficiency, renal or hepatic dysfunction, and neonates.
Concomitant use of phenobarbital and rifampin may lower chloramphenicol serum levels. Phenytoin may increase chloramphenicol serum levels. Chloramphenicol may increase the effects/toxicity
of phenytoin, chlorpropamide, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and oral anticoagulants and decrease absorption of vitamin B12. Chloramphenicol is an inhibitor of CYP 450 2C9.
Therapeutic levels: Peak: 15-25 mg/L for meningitis and 10-20 mg/L for other infections. Trough: 5-15 mg/L for meningitis and 5-10 mg/L for other infections. Recommended serum sampling time: trough within 30 min prior to next dose; peak 30 min after the end of infusion. Time to achieve steady state: 2-3 days for newborns; 12-24 hr for children and adults.

Contraindicated in the presence of retinal or visual field changes and known hypersensitivity to 4-aminoquinoline compounds. Use with caution in liver disease, preexisting auditory damage or seizures, G6PD deficiency, psoriasis, porphyria, or concomitant hepatotoxic drugs. May cause nausea, vomiting, electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, prolonged QT interval, blurred vision, retinal and corneal changes (reversible corneal opacities), headaches, confusion, skeletal muscle weakness, increased liver enzymes, and hair depigmentation. SJS, TEN, anaphylactic reactions, and maculopathy and macular degeneration have been reported. False-positive test for urine amphetamine screen may occur.
Antacids, ampicillin, and kaolin may decrease the absorption of chloroquine (allow 4-hr interval between these drugs and chloroquine). Cimetidine may increase effects/toxicity of chloroquine. May increase serum cyclosporine levels. Coadministration with mefloquine may increase risk of convul- sions. May reduce the antibody response to intradermal human diploid-cell rabies vaccine.
Monitor CBCs periodically with therapies of prolonged duration. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).

Biologic potency and oral absorption may be greater than ergocalciferol (vitamin D2). Requires activation by the liver (25-hydroxylation) and kidney (1-hydroxylation) to the active form, calcitriol. Recommended time period to recheck serum 25-OH vitamin D is 3 mo after initiation or change in dosage.
Monitor serum Ca2+, PO4, 25-0H vitamin D (goal level for infant and child: =20 ng/mL) and alkaline
phosphate. Serum Ca2+, PO4 product should be <70 mg/dL to avoid ectopic calcification. Serum 25-OH vitamin D level of =35 ng/mL has been used in cystic fibrosis patients to decrease the risk of hyperparathyroidism and bone loss.
Serum 25-OH vitamin D levels =100 ng/mL is considered toxic. Toxic effects in infants may result in nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, polydipsia, polyuria, muscle weakness, muscle/joint pain, confusion, and fatigue; renal damage may also occur.

Ciclesonide is a prodrug hydrolyzed to an active metabolite, des-ciclesonide via esterases in nasal mucosa and lungs; further metabolism via hepatic CYP3A4 and 2D6. Concurrent use with ketoconazole and other CYP 450 3A4 inhibitors may increase systemic des-ciclesonide levels. Use with caution and monitor in hepatic impairment.
Oral inhalation (asthma): Rinse mouth after each use. May cause headache, arthralgia, nasal congestion, nasopharyngitis, and URIs. Routinely monitor growth of pediatric patients. Maximum therapeutic benefit may not be achieved until 4 wk after initiation; consider dose increase if response is inadequate after 4 wk after initial dosage.
Intranasal (allergic rhinitis): Clear nasal passages prior to use. May cause otalgia, epistaxis, nasopharyngitis, and headache. Nasal septal perforation has been reported. Patients should be free of nasal disease, except for allergic rhinitis, before starting therapy. Monitor linear growth of pediatric patients routinely. Onset of action: 24-48 hr; further improvement observed over 1-2 wk in seasonal allergic rhinitis or 5 wk in perennial allergic rhinitis. Discontinue use if nasal erosion, ulceration, or perforation occurs.

BK virus hemorrhagic cystitis (limited data and other regimens exist): 1 mg/kg/dose IV once weekly WITHOUT probenecid.
Contraindicated in hypersensitivity to probenecid or sulfa-containing drugs; sCr >1.5 mg/dL, CrCl =55 mL/min, urine protein =100 mg/dL (2+ proteinuria), direct intraocular injection of cidofovir, and concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Renal impairment is the major dose- limiting toxicity. IV NS prehydration and probenecid must be used (unless not indicated) to reduce risk of nephrotoxicity. May also cause nausea, vomiting, headache, rash, metabolic acidosis, uveitis, decreased intraocular pressure, and neutropenia.
Reported criteria for defining renal dysfunction in children include a sCr >1.5 mg/dL, GFR <90 mL/ min/1.73 m2, and >2+ proteinuria. For adults, reduce dose to 3 mg/kg if sCr increases 0.3-0.4 mg/dL from baseline. Discontinue therapy if sCr increases =0.5 mg/dL from baseline or develop- ment of =3+ proteinuria.
Administer doses via IV infusion over 1 hr at a concentration =8 mg/mL.

Systemic fluoroquinolones are associated with disabling and potentially permanent side effects of the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system.
Can cause GI upset, renal failure, and seizures. GI symptoms, headache, restlessness, and rash are common side effects. Peripheral neuropathy, pseudotumor cerebri, severe hepatic necrosis, and psychiatric reactions have been reported. Use with caution in children <18 yr (like other quino- lones, tendon rupture can occur during or after therapy, especially with concomitant corticosteroid use), alkalinized urine (crystalluria), seizures, excessive sunlight (photosensitivity), and renal dysfunction (adjust systemic dose in renal failure; see Chapter 31). Blood glucose disturbances (hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia) have been reported in diabetic patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agent.
Do not use otic suspension with perforated tympanic membranes and with viral infections of the external ear canal.
For dosing in obese patients, use an adjusted body weight (ABW). ABW = ideal body weight + 0.45 (total body weight - ideal body weight).
Combinational antimicrobial therapy is recommended for anthrax. For penicillin-susceptible strains, consider changing to high-dose amoxicillin (25-35 mg/kg/dose TID PO). See www.bt.cdc.gov for the latest information.
Inhibits CYP 450 1A2. Ciprofloxacin can increase effects and/or toxicity of caffeine, methotrexate, theophylline, warfarin, tizanidine (excessive sedation and dangerous hypotension), and cyclospo- rine. Probenecid increases ciprofloxacin levels.
Do not administer antacids or other divalent salts with or within 2-4 hr of oral ciprofloxacin dose. Do not administer oral suspension through feeding tubes, because this dosage form adheres to the tube.

CLARITHROMYCIN continued
Contraindicated in patients allergic to erythromycin and history of cholestatic jaundice/ hepatic dysfunction with prior use. As with other macrolides, clarithromycin has been associated with QT prolongation (avoid use with other drugs known to prolong QT interval) and ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and torsades de pointes. May cause cardiac arrhythmias in patients also receiving cisapride. Side effects: diarrhea, nausea, abnormal taste, dyspepsia, abdominal discomfort (less than erythromycin but greater than azithromycin), and headache. Anaphylaxis, angioedema, hepatic dysfunction, rhabdomyolysis, SJS, and TEN have been reported.
May increase effects/toxicity of carbamazepine, theophylline, cyclosporine, digoxin, ergot alkaloids, fluconazole, midazolam, selected oral hypoglycemic agents, tacrolimus, triazolam, quetiapine, and warfarin. Substrate and inhibitor of CYP 450 3A4, and inhibits CYP 1A2.

injection site. Anaphylaxis, DRESS, SJS, severe taste alterations including metallic taste (with high IV doses), and TEN have been reported with systemic use. Eye pain and contact dermatitis have been reported with topical use.
Clindamycin may increase the neuromuscular blocking effects of tubocurarine and pancuronium.
Do not exceed IV infusion rate of 30 mg/min because hypotension and cardiac arrest have been reported with rapid infusions. May diminish the effects of erythromycin when
administered together. In vitro studies indicate clindamycin is a substrate and inhibitor for CYP 450 3A4.
Dosage reduction may be required in severe renal or hepatic disease but not necessary in mild/ moderate conditions. Oral liquid preparation may not be palatable; consider use of oral capsules as a sprinkle onto applesauce or pudding.

Seizures (generalized or partial, as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy; limited data and prescribing information from Canada and the United Kingdom):
Infant and child (<2 yr): Start at 0.5-1 mg/kg/24 hr (max. dose: 5 mg/24 hr) PO ÷ BID, if needed and tolerated, slowly increase dosage at 5-7 days intervals up to the maximum of 10 mg/kg/24 hr.
2-16 yr: Start at 5 mg PO once daily, if needed and tolerated, slowly increase dosage at 5-7 day intervals up to the maximum of 40 mg/kg/24 hr. Usual dosage range: 10-20 mg/24 hr or 0.3-1 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ BID.
Use with caution in hepatic impairment (dose adjustment may be needed). Do not discontinue use abruptly, as seizures/withdrawal symptoms may occur. Common side effects include constipation, drooling, ataxia, drowsiness, insomnia, aggressive behavior, cough, and fever. SJS, TEN, urinary retention, hypothermia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported.
Do not use in combination with azelastine, olanzapine, sodium oxybate, and thioridazine; increased risk of adverse events. Proton pump inhibitors, azole antifungal agents (e.g., itraconazole and ketoconazole), St. John's Wort, grapefruit juice, CNS depressants, cimetidine, and calcium channel blockers may increase the effects/toxicity of clobazam. Use with opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and mortality. Carbamazepine, rifamycin derivatives (e.g., rifampin), and theophylline may decrease the effects of clobazam. Clobazam is a major substrate for CYP 450 2C19 and P-glycoprotein, minor substrate for CYP 450 2B6 and 3A4, inhibitor of CYP 450 2D6, and inducer of CYP 3A4. Carefully review the patient's medication profile for other drug interactions each time clobazam is initiated or when a new drug is added to a regimen containing clobazam.
Doses may be taken with or without food. Tablets may be crushed and mixed with applesauce.

Infant and child: <10 yr or <30 kg:
Initial: 0.01-0.03 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ BID-TID; maximum initial dose: 0.05 mg/kg/24 hr.
Increment: 0.25-0.5 mg/24 hr Q3 days, up to maximum maintenance dose of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ TID
Child =10 yr or =30 kg and adult:
Initial: 1.5 mg/24 hr PO ÷ TID
Increment: 0.5-1 mg/24 hr Q3 days; max. dose: 20 mg/24 hr
Contraindicated in severe liver disease and acute narrow-angle glaucoma. Drowsiness, behavior changes, increased bronchial secretions, GI, CV, GU, and hematopoietic toxicity (thrombocytopenia, leukopenia) may occur. Monitor for depression, suicidal behavior/ ideation, and unusual changes in behavior/mood. Use with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function, porphyria, and renal impairment. Do not discontinue abruptly. T1/2 = 24-36 hr.
Proposed therapeutic levels (not well established): 20-80 ng/mL. Recommended serum sampling time: Obtain trough level within 30 min prior to an oral dose. Steady state is typically achieved after 5-8 days continuous therapy using the same dose.
Carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital may decrease clonazepam levels and effect. Drugs that inhibit CYP-450 3A4 isoenzymes (e.g., erythromycin) may increase clonazepam levels and effects/toxicity.

Injection, epidural (Duraclon and generics): 100, 500 mCg/mL (10 mL); preservative free
Hypertension (use immediate-release products unless noted):
Child (PO): 5-10 mCg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q8-12 hr initially; if needed, increase at 5- to 7-day intervals to 5-25 mCg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q6 hr; max. dose: 25 mCg/kg/24 hr up to 0.9 mg/24 hr.
=12 yr and adult (PO): 0.1 mg BID initially; increase in 0.1 mg/24 hr increments at weekly intervals
until desired response is achieved (usual range: adolescent: 0.2-0.6 mg/24 hr ÷ BID; adult: 0.1-0.8 mg/24 hr ÷ BID), max. dose: 2.4 mg/24 hr
Transdermal patch (each patch lasts 7 days by rotating application sites but more frequent patch change at every 5 days may be needed for children):
Child: conversion to patch only after establishing an optimal oral dose first. Use a transdermal dosage closest to the established total oral daily dose.
Adult: Initial 0.1 mg/24 hr patch for first week. May increase dose by 0.1 mg/24 hr at 1-2 wk intervals PRN. Usual range: 0.1-0.3 mg/24 hr. Doses >0.6 mg/24 hr do not provide additional benefit.
ADHD (Child =6 yr and adolescent):
Immediate-release product (PO):
=45 kg: Start with 0.05 mg QHS; if needed, increase by 0.05 mg/24 hr every 3-7 days as increments with BID, TID, and then QID dosing up to the following max. dose:
27-40.5 kg: 0.2 mg/24 hr
40.5-45 kg: 0.3 mg/24 hr

CLONIDINE continued
>45 kg: Start with 0.1 mg QHS; if needed, increase by 0.1 mg/24 hr every 3-7 days as increments with BID, TID, and then QID dosing up to the max. dose of 0.4 mg/24 hr.
Extended-release product (Kapvay and generics, PO): Start with 0.1 mg QHS; if needed, increase by
0.1 mg every 7 days by administering the dose BID up to a maximum of 0.4 mg/24 hr. Depending on dosage level, BID dosing should be either the same amount or with the higher dosage given at bedtime. If therapy is to be discontinued, slowly reduce dosage at =0.1 mg every 3 to 7 days to avoid withdrawal.
Neonatal abstinence syndrome, adjunctive therapy (use immediate-release product; limited data):
0.5-1 mCg/kg/dose Q4-6 hr PO; use Q6 hr interval for preterm neonates.
Side effects: Dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, constipation, anorexia, arrhythmias, and local skin reactions with patch. Somnolence, fatigue, URIs irritability, throat pain, insomnia, nightmares, and emotional disorder were reported as common side effects in ADHD clinical trials. May worsen sinus node dysfunction and AV block especially for patients taking other sympatholytic drugs. Do not abruptly discontinue; signs of sympathetic overactivity may occur; taper gradually over >1 wk.
ß-blockers may exacerbate rebound hypertension during and following the withdrawal of clonidine. If
patient is receiving both clonidine and a ß-blocker and clonidine is to be discontinued, the ß-blocker should be withdrawn several days prior to tapering the clonidine. If converting from clonidine over to a ß-blocker, introduce the ß-blocker several days after discontinuing clonidine (after taper).
Monitor heart rate when used with digitalis, calcium channel blockers, and ß-blockers. Use with dil-
tiazem or verapamil may result in sinus bradycardia. Use with neuroleptics may induce/exacerbate orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and fatigue. Consider using lower dosages in renal impairment because the drug is primarily eliminated unchanged in the urine and signs of bradycardia, seda- tion, and hypotension may occur.
T1/2: 44-72 hr (neonate), 6-20 hr (adult). Onset of action (antihypertensive): 0.5-1 hr for oral route, 2-3 days for transdermal route. Do not use transdermal route while patient is undergoing a mag- netic resonance imaging (MRI) procedure; transdermal patches contains metals and may result in serious patient burns when undergoing MRI.

Contraindicated in optic nerve atrophy. May cause hypokalemia, hypersensitivity (anaphylaxis shock and death reported with parenteral use), pruritis, and vascular thrombosis. Vitamin B12 use may mask folate deficiency and unmask polycythemia vera.
Prolonged use of acid-suppressing medications may reduce cyanocobalamin oral absorption.
Pregnancy category changes to "C" if used in doses greater than the RDA or if administered by the intranasal route.
Protect product from light. Some products may contain aluminum and may accumulate in renal impairment. Oral route of administration is generally not recommended for pernicious anemia and B12 deficiency due to poor absorption. IV route of administration is NOT recommended because of a more rapid elimination. See Chapter 21 for multivitamin preparations.

Ophthalmic solution: 0.5% (15 mL), 1% (2, 5, 15 mL), 2% (2, 5, 15 mL); may contain benzalkonium chloride
Administer dose approximately 40-50 min prior to examination/procedure.
Infant: Use of cyclopentolate/phenylephrine (Cyclomydril) due to lower cyclopentolate concentration and reduced risk of systemic side effects.

Psoriasis patients previously treated with PUVA and, to a lesser extent, methotrexate or other immunosuppressive agents, UVB, coal tar, or radiation therapy are at increased risk for skin malignancies when taking Neoral or Gengraf.
Opportunistic infections and activation of latent viral infections have been reported. BK virus-associated nephropathy has been observed in renal transplant patients.
Use caution with concomitant use of other nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., amphotericin B, aminoglycosides, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and tacrolimus).
Plasma concentrations increased with the use of boceprevir, telaprevir, fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, voriconazole, nefazodone, diltiazem, verapamil, nica- rdipine, carvedilol, and corticosteroids. Plasma concentrations decreased with the use of carba- mazepine, nafcillin, rifampin, oxcarbazepine, bosentan, phenobarbital, octreotide, and phenytoin. May increase bosentan, dabigatran, methotrexate, repaglinide, and anthracycline antibiotics (e.g., doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, daunorubicin) levels/effects/toxicity. Use with nifedipine may result in gingival hyperplasia. Cyclosporine is a substrate and inhibitor for CYP 450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein.
Children may require dosages 2-3 times higher than adults. Plasma half-life 6-24 hr.
Monitor trough levels (just prior to a dose at steady state). Steady state is generally achieved after 3-5 days of continuous dosing. Interpretation will vary based on treatment protocol and assay methodology (RIA monoclonal vs. RIA polyclonal vs. HPLC), as well as whole blood vs. serum sample. Additional monitoring and dosage adjustments may be necessary in renal and hepatic impairment or when changing dosage forms.
For ophthalmic use: Ocular burning may occur. Remove contact lens prior to use; lens may be inserted 15 min after dose administration. May be used with artificial tears but need to be separated by 15 min for one another.

Contraindicated in uncontrolled hypertension and patients hypersensitive to albumin/ polysorbate 80 or epoetin alfa. Darbepoetin alfa is not intended for patients requiring acute correction of anemia. Use with caution in seizures and liver disease. Erythema multiforme, SJS, and TEN have been reported. Evaluate serum iron, feritin, and TIBC; concurrent iron supplementation may be necessary. Red cell aplasia and severe anemia associated with neutralizing antibodies to erythropoietin have been reported.
USE IN CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Higher doses may be needed for pediatric patients being switched from epoetin alfa than those for naïve patients. May cause edema, fatigue, GI disturbances, head- ache, blood pressure changes, fever, cardiac arrhythmia/arrest, infections and myalgia. Higher risk for mortality and serious cardiovascular events have been reported with higher targeted hemoglobin levels (>11 g/dL). If hemoglobin levels do not increase or reach targeted levels despite appropriate dose titrations over a 12 wk period, (1) do not administer higher doses and use the lowest dose that will maintain hemoglobin levels to avoid the need for recurrent blood transfusions; (2) evaluate and

treat other causes of anemia; (3) always follow the dose adjustment instructions; and (4) discontinue use if patient remains transfusion dependent.
USE IN CANCER: Use only for anemia due to myelosuppressive chemotherapy; not effective in reducing the need for transfusions in patients with anemia not due to chemotherapy. Shortened survival and time to tumor progression have been reported in patients with various cancers. May cause fatigue, fever, edema, dizziness, headache, GI disturbances, arthralgia/myalgia, and rash. Use lowest dose to avoid transfusions and do not exceed hemoglobin levels >12 g/dL; increased frequency of adverse events, including mortality and thrombotic vascular events, have been reported. Prescribers and hospitals must enroll in and comply with the ESA APPRISE Oncology Program to prescribe and/or dispense this drug to cancer patients.
Monitor hemoglobin, BP, serum chemistries, and reticulocyte count. Increases in dose should not be made more frequently than once a mo. For IV administration, infuse over 1-3 min.

dose of 0.6 mg/24 hr.
Use with caution in hypertension, patients at risk for water intoxication with hyponatremia, and coronary artery disease. May cause headache, nausea, seizures, blood pressure changes, hyponatremia, nasal congestion, abdominal cramps, and hypertension.
Desmopressin is primarily excreted in the urine, and renal impairment may increase the elimination half-life (some consider use contraindicated when GFR is <50 mL/min).
NOCTURNAL ENURESIS: Intranasal formulations are no longer indicated by the FDA for primary noctur- nal enuresis (children are susceptible for severe hyponatremia and seizures) or in patients with a

Suspension: Shake well before using. Instill 1-2 drops in the conjunctival sac(s) of the affected eye(s) up to 4-6 times/24 hr. For severe disease, drops may be used Q1 hr, being tapered to discontinuation as inflammation subsides. For mild disease, drops may be used =4-6 times/24 hr.
Not recommended for systemic therapy in the prevention or treatment of chronic lung disease in infants with very low birth weight because of increased risk for adverse events. Dexamethasone is a substrate of CYP P450 3A3/4 and P-glycoprotein, and a moderate inducer of CYP P450 3A4.
Compared to prednisone, dexamethasone has no mineralocorticoid effects with greater glucocorticoid effects. Consider use of alternative low glucocorticoid systemic steroid for patients with hyperglycemia. Contraindicated in active untreated infections and fungal, viral, and mycobacterial ocular infections.

Procedural sedation:
Child (limited data):
IV: 2 mCg/kg/dose ×1 IV followed by 1.5 mCg/kg/hr was administered to children with autism/perva- sive developmental disorders for sedation for electroencephalography (EEG).
IM: 1-4.5 mCg/kg/dose ×1 IM was administered to children for sedation for EEG. Extremely anxious, inconsolable, aggressive, and noncompliant children received doses >2.5 mCg/kg; and calm and relatively compliant children received doses =2.5 mCg/kg. A second lower repeat dose (~2 mCg/kg/ dose IM) was administered adequate sedation was not achieved after 10 min of the first dose.
Intranasal route (limited data): 1-2 mCg/kg/dose ×1 for premedication 30-60 min prior to anes- thesia induction.
Adult: 0.5-1 mCg/kg/dose IV ×1 over 10 min, followed by 0.6 mCg/kg/hr titrated to effect; dosage has ranged from 0.2-1 mCg/kg/hr.
Use with caution with other vasodilating or negative chronotropic agents (additive pharmacodynamic effects), hepatic impairment (decrease drug clearance; consider dose reduction), advanced heart block, hypovolemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic hypertension, and severe ventricular dysfunction. Prolonged use >24 hr may be associated with tolerance and tachyphylaxis and dose-related side effects (ARDS, respiratory failure and agitation).
Withdrawal symptoms within 24 hr after discontinuing dexmedetomidine have been reported in ~5% of adults receiving the medication up to 7 days regardless of dosage; no withdrawal symptoms were seen in adults after discontinuing therapy lasting <6 hr in duration.
Hypotension and bradycardia are common side effects; may be more pronounced in hypovolemia, diabetes or chronic hypertension. Transient hypertension has been observed during loading doses. QT prolongation, hypernatremia, sinus arrest, and polyuria have been reported. Do not abruptly withdraw therapy, as withdrawal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, and agitation) are possible; taper the dose when discontinuing use.

D
DEXMEDETOMIDINE continued
Use with anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics, and opioids may lead to enhanced effects; consider dosage reduction of dexmedetomidine. Dexmedetomidine is a CYP 450 2A6 substrate and a weak inhibitor of CYP 450 1A2, 2C9, and 3A4.
Onset of action for procedural sedation: IV or IM: 15 min, intranasal: 15-30 min. Duration of action for procedural sedation: IM: 1 hr, intranasal: 1-1.5 hr.
This drug should be administered by individuals skilled in the management of patients in the ICU and OR. Concentrated IV solution (100 mCg/1 mL) must be diluted with NS to a concentration of 4 mCg/mL prior to administration. See Chapter 6 for additional information.

DEXTROAMPHETAMINE ± AMPHETAMINE continued
Use with caution in presence of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and renal or hepatic impairment (drug elimination may be decreased). Avoid use in known serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems that may increase risk of sympathomimetic effects of amphetamines (sudden death, stroke, and MI have been reported). Do not give with MAO inhibitors (also within 14 days of discontinuance) or general anesthetics. Use with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may reduce the effectiveness of either dextroamphetamine or the combination with amphetamine.
DEXTROAMPHETAMINE AND AMPHETAMINE: Serotonin syndrome may occur when used with seroto- nergic neurotransmitter medications such as MAO inhibitors, SSRIs, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), triptans, and TCAs. CYP 450 2D6 inhibitors may increase the effects/ toxicity of the combination medication.
Not recommended for <3 yr. Medication should generally not be used in children <5 yr old, as diag- nosis of attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in this age group is extremely difficult (use in consultation with a specialist). Interrupt administration occasionally to determine need for continued therapy. Many side effects, including insomnia (avoid dose administration within 6 hr of bedtime), restlessness/irritability, anorexia, psychosis, visual disturbances, headache, vomiting, abdominal cramps, dry mouth, and growth failure. Paranoia, mania, peripheral vasculopathy (including Raynaud phenomenon), priapism, bruxism, and auditory hallucination have been reported. Assess for risk of abuse and dependence prior to prescribing. Tolerance develops. Same guidelines as for methylphenidate apply. See Amphetamine for amphetamine-containing products.

Contraindicated in myasthenia gravis, severe respiratory insufficiency, severe hepatic failure, and sleep apnea syndrome. Hypotension and respiratory depression may occur. Use with caution in hepatic and renal dysfunction, glaucoma, shock, and depression. Do not use in combination with protease inhibitors. Concurrent use with CNS depressants, cimetidine, erythromycin, itraconazole, and valproic acid may enhance the effects of diazepam. Use with opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma and mortality. Diazepam is a substrate for CYP 450 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, and 3A5-7, and minor substrate and inhibitor for CYP 450 2C19 and 3A3/4. The active desmethyldiazepam metabolite is a CYP 450 2C19 substrate.
Administer the conventional IV product undiluted no faster than 2 mg/min and do not mix with IV fluids.
In status epilepticus, diazepam must be followed by long-acting anticonvulsants. Onset of anticonvulsant effect: 1-3 min with IV route; 2-10 min with rectal route. For management of status epilepticus, see Chapter 1.


Oral suspension: 50 mg/mL (30 mL); contains 7.25% alcohol

Newborn and infant: Start at 5 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q8-12 hr PO and gradually titrate if needed; usual
range of 8-15 mg/kg/24 hr with reported range of 5-20 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q8-12 hr
Child and adolescent: Start at 5 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ 8 hr PO and gradually titrate if needed; usual range: 3-8 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q8-12 hr PO

DIAZOXIDE continued
Hypoglycemia should be treated initially with IV glucose; diazoxide should be introduced only if refractory to glucose infusion. Should not be used in patients hypersensitive to thiazides unless benefit outweighs risk. Thiazides may enhance diazoxide's hyperglycemic effects. Use with caution in renal impairment (clearance of drug is reduced); consider dosage reduction.
Sodium and fluid retention is common in young infants and adults and may precipitate congestive heart failure (CHF) in patients with compromised cardiac reserve (usually responsive to diuret- ics). Hirsutism (reversible), GI disturbances, transient loss of taste, tachycardia, ketoacidosis, palpitations, rash, headache, weakness, and hyperuricemia may occur. Pulmonary hypertension in newborns/infant treated for hypoglycemia has been reported as resolution/improvement of the condition was achieved after discontinuance of diazoxide. Monitor BP closely for hypotension.
Hyperglycemic effect with PO administration occurs within 1 hr, with a duration of 8 hr.

Initial: 1/2 TDD, then 1/4 TDD Q8-18 hr ×2 doses; obtain electrocardiogram (ECG) 6 hr after dose to assess for toxicity
Maintenance:
<10 yr: Give maintenance dose ÷ BID
=10 yr: Give maintenance dose once daily
Contraindicated in patients with ventricular dysrhythmias. Use should be avoided in patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function. Use with caution in renal failure, with calcium channel blockers (may result in heart block), and with adenosine (enhanced depressant effects on sinoatrial [SA] and atrioventricular [AV] nodes). May cause AV block or dysrhythmias. In patients treated with digoxin, cardioversion, or calcium infusion, may lead to ventricular fibrillation (pretreatment with lidocaine may prevent this). Patients with beri beri heart disease may not respond to digoxin if underlying thiamine deficiency is not treated concomitantly. Decreased serum potassium and magnesium, or increased magnesium and calcium may increase risk for digoxin toxicity. For signs and symptoms of toxicity, see Chapter 3.
Excreted via the kidney; adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31). Therapeutic concentration: 0.8-2 ng/mL. Higher doses may be required for supraventricular tachycardia. Neonates, pregnant women, and patients with renal, hepatic, or heart failure may have falsely elevated digoxin levels, due to the presence of digoxin-like substances.
Digoxin is a CYP450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein substrate. Calcium channel blockers, captopril, carvedilol, amiodarone, quinidine, cyclosporine, itraconazole, tetracycline, and macrolide antibiotics may increase digoxin levels. Use with ß-blockers and ivabradine may increase risk for bradycardia. Succinylcholine may cause arrhythmias in digitalized patients.
T1/2: Premature infants, 61-170 hr; full-term neonates, 35-45 hr; infants, 18-25 hr; and children, 35 hr.
Recommended serum sampling at steady state: Obtain a single level from 6 hr postdose to just before the next scheduled dose following 5-8 days of continuous dosing. Levels obtained prior to steady state may be useful in preventing toxicity.

Continuous IV infusion (all ages): 2-20 mCg/kg/min
Max. dose: 40 mCg/kg/min
To prepare infusion: see IV infusions on page i
Contraindicated in idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (IHSS). Tachycardia, arrhythmias (premature ventricular contractions [PVCs]), and hypertension may occasionally occur (especially at higher infusion rates). Correct hypovolemic states before use. Increases AV conduction, and may precipitate ventricular ectopic activity.
Dobutamine has been shown to increase cardiac output and systemic pressure in pediatric patients of every age group. However, in premature neonates, dobutamine is less effective than dopamine in raising systemic blood pressure without causing undue tachycardia, and dobutamine has not been shown to provide any added benefit when given to such infants already receiving optimal infusions of dopamine.
Monitor BP and vital signs. T1/2: 2 min. Peak effects in 10-20 min. Use with linezolid may potentially increase blood pressure. Use with catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors (e.g., entaca- pone) may increase heart rate, arrhythmias, and changes in blood pressure.

2-16 yr: 0.35 mg/kg/dose (max. dose: 12.5 mg) IV
>16 yr-adult: 12.5 mg/dose IV
May cause hypotension and prolongation of cardiac conduction intervals, particularly QTc interval (dose-dependent effect). Common side effects include dizziness, headache, sedation, blurred vision, fever, chills, and sleep disorders. Rare cases of sustained supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, fatal cardiac arrest, and MI have been reported in children and adolescents.
Avoid use in patients with congenital long QTc syndrome, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, or with concurrent use with other drugs that increase QTc interval (e.g., erythromycin, cisapride). Drug's active metabolite (hydrodolasetron) is a substrate for CYP 450 2D6 and 3A3/4 isoenzymes; concomitant use of enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine) may increase risk for side effects, and use of enzyme inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease dolasetron's efficacy. Serotonin syndrome has been associated with concurrent use of SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline), SNRIs (e.g., duloxetine, venlafaxine), MAO inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and IV methylene blue.
Although no dosage adjustments are necessary, hydrodolasetron's clearance decreases 42% with severe hepatic impairment and 44% with severe renal impairment.
ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities, CHF, bradyarrhythmias or renal impairment.
IV doses may be administered undiluted over 30 sec.


Injection: 40 mg/mL (5, 10 mL)
Prediluted injection in D5W: 0.8, 1.6, 3.2 mg/mL (250, 500 mL)
All ages:
Low dose: 2-5 mCg/kg/min IV; increases renal blood flow; minimal effect on heart rate and cardiac output
Intermediate dose: 5-15 mCg/kg/min IV; increases heart rate, cardiac contractility, cardiac output, and to a lesser extent, renal blood flow.
High dose: >15 mCg/kg/min IV; a adrenergic effects are prominent; decreases renal perfusion.
Max. dose recommended: 20-50 mCg/kg/min IV
To prepare infusion: see IV infusions on page i.
Do not use in pheochromocytoma, tachyarrhythmias, or hypovolemia. Monitor vital signs and blood pressure continuously. Correct hypovolemic states. Tachyarrhythmias, ectopic beats, hypertension, vasoconstriction, and vomiting may occur. Use with caution with phenytoin because hypotension and bradycardia may be exacerbated. Use with linezolid may potentially increase blood pressure.
Newborn infants may be more sensitive to the vasoconstrictive effects of dopamine. Children
<2 yr of age clear dopamine faster, and high variability in neonates is exhibited.
Should be administered through a central line or large vein. Extravasation may cause tissue necrosis; treat with phentolamine. Do not administer into an umbilical arterial catheter.

Methylxanthine-refractory neonatal apnea (see remarks): Load with 2.5-3 mg/kg IV over 15 min, followed by a continuous IV infusion of 1 mg/kg/hr titrated to the lowest effective dose; max. dose: 2.5 mg/kg/hr
Contraindicated in seizures, proven or suspected pulmonary embolism, head injuries, cerebral vascular accident, cerebral edema, cardiovascular or coronary artery disease, severe hypertension, pheochromocytoma, hyperthyroidism, and in patients with mechanical disorders of ventilation. Do not use with general anesthetic agents that can sensitize the heart to catecholamines (e.g., halothane, cyclopropane, and enflurane) to reduce the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Do not initiate doxapram until the general anesthetic agent has been completely excreted.
Assess the benefit-risk of benzyl alcohol exposure to neonates. Hypertension occurs with higher doses (>1.5 mg/kg/hr). May also cause tachycardia, arrhythmias, seizure, hyperreflexia, hyperpyrexia, abdominal distension, bloody stools, and sweating. Avoid extravasation into tissues.

Use with caution in hepatic and renal disease. Generally not recommended for use in children <8 yr due to risk for tooth enamel hypoplasia and discoloration. However, the AAP Redbook recommends doxycycline as the drug of choice for rickettsial disease regardless of age and the use in children <8 yr for short treatment courses (=21 days). May cause GI symptoms, photosensitivity, hemolytic anemia, rash, and hypersensitivity reactions.
Increased intracranial pressure (pseudotumor cerebri), TEN, DRESS, erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported.
Doxycycline is approved for the treatment of anthrax (Bacillus anthracis) in combination with one or two other antimicrobials. If meningitis is suspected, consider using an alternative agent because of poor CNS penetration. Consider changing to high-dose amoxicillin (25-35 mg/kg/dose TID PO) for penicillin-susceptible strains. See www.bt.cdc.gov for the latest information.
Rifampin, barbiturates, phenytoin, and carbamazepine may increase clearance of doxycycline. Doxycycline may enhance the hypoprothrombinemic effect of warfarin. See Tetracycline for addi- tional drug/food interactions and remarks.
Infuse IV over 1-4 hr. Avoid prolonged exposure to direct sunlight. For periodontitis, take tablets =1 hr prior or 2 hr after meals.

ELEXACAFTOR/TEZACAFTOR/IVACAFTOR continued
All three components of this medication are substrates of CYP 450 3A. Avoid use in combination with strong inducers of CYP 450 3A (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John's wort). Use with moderate and strong CYP 3A inhibitors requires dose reductions;
see dosing section. Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor may increase the effects/toxicity of digoxin, cyclosporine, everolimus, glimepiride, glipizide, glyburide, nateglinide, repaglinide, sirolimus, tacrolimus, and warfarin. Always evaluate the potential drug-drug interactions.
Avoid food or drink containing grapefruit or Seville oranges.
Administer all doses with high-fat foods to assure absorption. If a dose is missed within 6 hr of a scheduled dose, administer the respective morning or evening dose immediately and resume usual dosing. However, if the missed dose is >6 hr, the following is recommended:
Missed morning dose: take missed dose as soon as possible and do not take evening dose for that day; then resume usual dosing the next day.
Missed evening dose: do not take the missed dose; then resume usual dosing the next day. Never take a double dose for a missed dose.

DVT prophylaxis:
Infant <2 mo: 0.75 mg/kg/dose Q12 hr SC
Infant =2 mo-child 18 yr: 0.5 mg/kg/dose Q12 hr SC; max. dose: 30 mg/dose
Patients with indwelling epidural catheters/neuraxial anesthesia (=2 mo-child 18 yr): 1 mg/kg/
dose Q24 hr SC; max. dose: 40 mg/dose. Twice-daily dosing is contraindicated for these patients.
See remarks.
Adjust dosage for DVT prophylaxis to achieve target anti-factor Xa levels of 0.1-0.3 units/mL for all children.
Adult:
Knee or hip replacement surgery: 30 mg BID SC ×7-14 days; initiate therapy 12-24 hr after sur- gery provided hemostasis is established. Alternatively, for hip replacement surgery, 40 mg once daily SC ×7-14 days initially up to 3 wk thereafter; initiate therapy 9-15 hr prior to surgery.
Inhibits thrombosis by inactivating factor Xa without significantly affecting bleeding time, platelet function, PT, or aPTT at recommended doses. Dosages of enoxaparin, heparin, or other LMWHs CANNOT be used interchangeably on a unit-for-unit (or mg-for-mg) basis because of differences in pharmacokinetics and activity. Peak anti-factor Xa LMWH activity is achieved 4 hr after a SC dose. Anti-factor Xa LMWH is NOT THE SAME as unfractionated heparin anti-factor Xa level (used for monitoring heparin therapy).
Contraindicated in major bleeding, drug-induced thrombocytopenia, and pork hypersensitivity. Use with caution in uncontrolled arterial hypertension, bleeding diathesis, history of recurrent GI ulcers, diabetic retinopathy, and severe renal dysfunction (reduce dose by increasing the dosage interval from Q12 hr to Q24 hr if GFR <30 mL/min). Prophylactic use is not recommended in patients with prosthetic heart valves (especially in pregnant women) due to reports of fatalities in patients and fetuses. Concurrent use with spinal or epidural anesthesia or spinal puncture
has resulted in long-term or permanent paralysis; potential benefits must be weighed against the risks. May cause fever, confusion, edema, nausea, hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia (including heparin-induced thrombocytopenia ± thrombosis [HIT/HITTS]), hypochromic anemia, and pain/ erythema at injection site. Allergic reactions, headache, eosinophilia, alopecia, hepatocellular and cholestatic liver injury, and osteoporosis (long-term use) have been reported. Protamine sulfate is the antidote; 1 mg protamine sulfate neutralizes 1 mg enoxaparin.
DVT prophylaxis for patients with epidural catheters/neuraxial anesthesia: If placing needle, hold anticoagulation for 12 hr and restart dosing no sooner than 4 hr after needle insertion. If removing catheter, hold anticoagulation for 12 hr and restart dosing no sooner than 2 hr after catheter removal.
Recommended anti-factor Xa LMWH levels obtained 4 hr after subcutaneous dose after the third consecutive dose for children (anti-factor Xa LMWH response in children is highly variable compared to adults):
DVT treatment: 0.5-1 units/mL DVT prophylaxis: 0.1-0.3 units/mL
Administer by deep SC injection by having the patient lie down. Alternate administration between the left and right anterolateral and left and right posterolateral abdominal wall. See package insert for detailed SC administration recommendations. To minimize bruising, do not rub the injection site. IM route of administration is not recommended.

High-dose rescue therapy for in-hospital cardiac arrest in children after failure of an initial standard dose has been reported to be of no benefit compared to standard dose (N Engl J Med 2004;350:1722-1730).
May produce arrhythmias, tachycardia, hypertension, headaches, nervousness, nausea, vomiting, and rare cases of stress cardiomyopathy. Necrosis may occur at site of repeated local injection. Rare cases of serious skin and soft tissue infections, including necrotizing fasciitis and myonecrosis, have been reported with IM or deep SC injections.
Concomitant use of noncardiac selective ß-blockers, MAO inhibitors, COMT inhibitors, clonidine, or
tricyclic antidepressants may enhance epinephrine's pressor response. Chlorpromazine, diuretics, nitrates, or a-blockers may reverse the pressor response. Do not use products containing chlorobuta- nol for ophthalmic use, as it may be harmful to the corneal endothelium.
ETT doses should be diluted with NS to a volume of 3-5 mL before administration. Follow with several positive pressure ventilations.
Hypersensitivity reactions: For bronchial asthma and certain allergic manifestations (e.g., angioedema, urticaria, serum sickness, anaphylactic shock), use epinephrine SC. Patients with anaphylaxis may ben- efit from IM administration. The adult IV dose for hypersensitivity reactions or to relieve bronchospasm usually ranges from 0.1 to 0.25 mg injected slowly over 5-10 min Q5-15 min as needed. Neonates may be given a dose of 0.01 mg/kg body weight; for infants, 0.05 mg is an adequate initial dose, and this may be repeated at 20- to 30-min intervals in the management of asthma attacks.
Due to the inconsistent availability of autoinjector products, periodic reeducation of available device may be necessary. See respective autoinjector product for proper dose administration methods including methods to prevent injury and/or inadvertent dose administration to the individual admin- istering the dose. Accidental injection into the digits, hand, or feet may result in the loss of blood flow to the affected area. Do not inject into the buttock area.

Initial dose:
Child and adolescent: Start at 50 U/kg/dose 3 times per week. Reported dosage range for children (3 mo-20 yr) not requiring dialysis, 50-250 U/kg/dose 3 times per week. Reported dosage range for children receiving hemodialysis, 50-450 U/kg/dose 2-3 times per week.
Adult: Start at 50-100 U/kg/dose 3 times per week
Maintenance dose: Dose is individualized to achieve and maintain the lowest Hgb level sufficient to avoid transfusions and not to exceed 11 g/dL.
Anemia in cancer (use until chemotherapy is completed; see remarks for dosage reduction and withholding therapy):
Initial dose:
Child (5-18 yr): Start at 600 U/kg (max. dose: 40,000 U) IV once weekly.
Adult: Start at 150 U/kg/dose SC 3 times per week or 40,000 U SC once every week.
Increasing doses (if needed):
Three-times-a-week dosing regimen (adult): If no increase in Hgb >1 g/dL and Hgb remains <10 g/dL after initial 4 wk of therapy, increase dosage to 300 U/kg/dose 3 times per week.
Weekly dosing regimen: If no increase in Hgb >1 g/dL and Hgb remains <10 g/dL after initial 4 wk of therapy:
Child: Increase dose to 900 U/kg/dose IV (max. dose: 60,000 U) once weekly.
Adult: 60,000 U SC once weekly.
For all ages, discontinue use after 8 wk of therapy if transfusions are still required or no hemoglobin response is observed.
AZT-treated HIV patients (Hgb should not exceed 12 g/dL): SC/IV
Child: Reported dosage range in children (=3 mo-17 yr), 50-400 U/kg/dose 2-3 times per wk.
Adult (with serum erythropoietin =500 milliunits/mL and receiving =4200 mg AZT per week): Start
at 100 U/kg/dose 3 times per wk ×8 wk. If response is NOT satisfactory in reducing transfusion requirements or increasing Hgb levels after 8 wk of therapy, dose may be increased by 50-100 U/ kg/dose given 3 times per wk and reevaluated every 4-8 wk thereafter. Patients are unlikely to respond to doses >300 U/kg/dose 3 times per wk.
For all ages, withhold therapy if Hgb >12 g/dL and resume therapy by decreasing dosage by 25% once Hgb falls below 11 g/dL. For adults, discontinue therapy if Hgb does not increase after 8 wk of the 300 U/kg/dose 3 times per wk dosage.
Anemia of prematurity (many regimens exist):
250 U/kg/dose SC 3 times per wk ×10 doses; alternatively, 200-400 U/kg/dose IV/SC 3-5 times per wk for 2-6 wk (total dose per wk is 600-1400 U/kg). Administer with supplemental iron at 3-6 mg elemental iron/kg/24 hr.
Use the lowest dose to avoid transfusions.
Increased risk for death, serious cardiovascular events, and thrombosis/stroke have been reported in patients treated with chronic kidney disease and hemoglobin levels >11 g/dL.
Increased risk for death, shortened survival and/or shortened time to tumor progression/regression,

serious cardiovascular events, and thrombosis in various cancer patients, especially with Hgb levels
>12 g/dL, have been reported with epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.
Evaluate serum iron, ferritin, TIBC before therapy. Iron supplementation recommended during therapy unless iron stores are already in excess. Monitor Hct, BP, clotting times, platelets, BUN, serum creatinine. Peak effect in 2-3 wk.
DOSAGE ADJUSTMENT FOR ANEMIA IN CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:
Reduce dose by =25%: when Hgb increases >1 g/dL in any 2-wk period. Dose reductions can be made more frequently than once every 4 wk if needed.
Increase dose by 25%: when Hgb does not increase by 1 g/dL after 4 wk of therapy. Dosage incre- ments should not be made more frequently than once every 4 wk.
Withholding therapy: when Hgb >11 g/dL; restart therapy at a 25% lower dose after Hgb decreases to target levels or <11 g/dL.
Inadequate response after a 12-week dose escalation: Use minimum effective dosage that will maintain hemoglobin levels to avoid the need for recurrent blood transfusions and evaluate other causes of anemia. Discontinue use if patient remains transfusion dependent.
DOSAGE REDUCTION ADJUSTMENT/WITHHOLDING THERAPY FOR ANEMIA IN CANCER:
If Hgb exceeds a level needed to avoid blood transfusion: Withhold dose and resume therapy at a reduced dosage by 25% when Hgb approaches a level where blood transfusions may be needed.
If Hgb increases >1 g/dL in any 2-wk period or Hgb reaches a level to avoid blood transfusion: Reduce dose by 25%.
May cause hypertension, seizure, hypersensitivity reactions, headache, edema, dizziness. SC route provides sustained serum levels compared to IV route. For IV administration, infuse over 1-3 min.

Hypoparathyroidism (with calcium supplementation):
Child: 50,000-200,000 IU/24 hr PO
Adult: 25,000-200,000 IU/24 hr PO
Consider using cholecalciferol instead; cholecalciferol has shown to be more biologically potent with better absorption than ergocalciferol. Vitamin D2 is activated by 25-hydroxylation in liver and 1-hydroxylation in kidney to the active form, calcitriol.
Monitor serum Ca{2+}, PO4, 25-OH vitamin D (goal level for infant and child: =20 ng/mL), and alkaline
phosphate. Serum Ca{2+}, PO4 product should be <70 mg/dL to avoid ectopic calcification. Titrate dosage to patient response. Watch for symptoms of hypercalcemia: weakness, diarrhea, polyuria, metastatic calcification, nephrocalcinosis.
Serum 25-OH vitamin D level of =35 ng/mL has been suggested in cystic fibrosis patients to decrease
the risk of hyperparathyroidism and bone loss.
Pregnancy category changes to "C" if used in doses above the US RDA.

Topical (administer doses after washing skin with warm water and soap and patting it dry): Acne (=7 yr-adolescent; typically not used as monotherapy):
Topical gel: Apply to affected area once daily-BID; discontinue use after 8 wk if no improvement or worsening of condition.
Topical solution or pad: Apply to affected area BID (morning and evening).
Avoid use in patients with known QT prolongation, proarrhythmic conditions (e.g., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, significant bradycardia), and receiving class IA or class III antiarrhythmic agents, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors metabolized by CYP 450 3A4 (e.g., lovastatin or simvastatin; increases risk for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis), cisapride, or pimozide.
Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in neonates receiving prophylactic therapy for pertussis; life- threatening episodes of ventricular tachycardia associated with prolonged QTc interval; and exacerbation of myasthenia gravis have been reported. May produce false-positive urinary catecholamines, 17-hydroxycorticosteroids, and 17-ketosteroids.
GI side effects common (nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps). Cardiac dysrhythmia, anaphylaxis, interstitial nephritis, and hearing loss have been reported. Use with caution in liver disease. Estolate formulation may cause cholestatic jaundice, although hepatotoxicity is uncommon (2% of reported cases). Inhibits CYP 450 1A2, 3A3/4 isoenzymes. May produce elevated digoxin, theophylline, carba- mazepine, clozapine, cyclosporine, and methylprednisolone levels. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31). Use ideal body weight for obese patients when calculating doses.
Oral therapy should replace IV as soon as possible. Give oral doses after meals. Because of different absorption characteristics, higher oral doses of EES are needed to achieve therapeutic effects. Avoid IM route (pain, necrosis). For ophthalmic use, avoid contact of ointment tip with eye or skin.

Oral solution: 1 mg/mL (240 mL); contains parabens and propylene glycol
Depression:
<12 yr: Limited data, only one placebo-controlled RCT did not demonstrate efficacy.
=12 yr and adolescent: Start with 10 mg PO once daily. If needed after 3 wk, dose may be increased to 20 mg once daily.
Adult: Start with 10 mg PO once daily. If needed after 1 wk, dose may be increased to 20 mg once daily.
Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD; limited data)
6-17 yr: A 10-wk open-label trial in which 28 subjects were given a weekly PRN increasing PO dosage regimen of 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/24 hr. Mean dosage of responders with significant improvement at 11.1 ± 6.5 mg/24 hr. 25% of subjects responded at doses <10 mg/24 hr and 36% responded at doses = 10 mg/24 hr. Seven of the 17 (41%) responders and 25% of all treated subjects could not tolerate the 10-mg/24 hr dose.
Social Anxiety Disorder (limited data):
10-17 yr: A 12-wk open-label trial in which 20 subjects were given an initial PO dosage of 5 mg once daily × 7 days followed by 10 mg once daily. If needed and tolerated, increase by 5 mg/24 hr at weekly intervals up to a maximum of 20 mg/24 hr. Two subjects did not complete the trial due to lack of efficacy and tolerability. Sixty-five percent of the remaining subjects met the response
criteria with a mean final dose of 13 ± 4.1 mg/24 hr. Common adverse events included somnolence (25%), insomnia (20%), flu symptoms (15%), increased appetite (15%), and decreased appetite
(15%).
Increased risk for serotonin syndrome when used with MAO inhibitors (or within 14 days of discontinuance), linezolid, or methylene blue; concurrent use considered contraindicated. Do not use with pimozide because of risk for increased QTc interval. Use with caution with hepatic or severe renal impairment; dosage adjustment may be needed. Avoid abrupt discontinuation to prevent withdrawal symptoms.
Diaphoresis, GI discomfort, xerostomia, dizziness, headache, insomnia, somnolence, sexual dysfunction, and fatigue are common side effects. Abnormal bleeding, depression, QTc prolongation, and suicidal ideation have been reported.
Primarily metabolized by the CYP 450 2C19 and 3A4 enzymes and is a weak inhibitor for CYP 450 2D6 enzyme. Consider an alternative medication (not significantly metabolized by CYP 450 2C19) for individuals with ultrarapid CYP 450 2C19 activity. Poor CYP450 2C19 metabolizers can either initiate therapy at 50% the usual dose and titrate to response or consider alternative therapy.
Taking with other medications with QTc prolongation may further increase that risk. Omeprazole may increase the toxicity of escitalopram. Doses may be administered with or without food.

ETANERCEPT continued
Contraindicated in serious infections, sepsis, or hypersensitivity to any of medication components. Use with caution in patients with history of recurrent infections (including hepatitis B) or underlying conditions that may predispose them to infections (including concomitant immunosuppressive therapy), CNS demyelinating disorders, malignancies, immune-related diseases, and latex allergy. Common adverse effects in children include headache, abdominal pain, vomiting, and nausea. Injection site reactions (e.g., discomfort, itching, swelling), rhinitis, dizziness, rash, depression, infections (varicella, aseptic meningitis, rare cases of TB, and fatal/ serious infections and sepsis), bone marrow suppression (e.g., aplastic anemia), sarcoidosis, vertigo, and CNS demyelinating disorder have also been reported. Malignancies (some fatal and
~50% were lymphomas) have been reported in children and adolescents.
Do not administer live vaccines concurrently with this drug. In JRA, it is recommended that before initiating therapy, the patient be brought up to date with all immunizations in agreement with cur- rent immunization guidelines.
Onset of action is 1-4 wk, with peak effects usually within 3 mo.
Patients must be properly instructed on preparing and administering the medication (see specific product information). For multi-dose vial, reconstitute vial by gently swirling its contents with the supplied diluent (do not shake or vigorously agitate), as some foaming will occur. Reconstituted solutions should be clear and colorless; unused portions must be stored in the refrigerator and used within 14 days. Do not store Auto Touch auto-injector device in the refrigerator.
Drug is administered subcutaneously by rotating injection sites (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm) with a max. single injection site dose of 25 mg. Administer new injections =1 inch from an old site and NEVER where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard.

A Q12-hr dosage interval is generally recommended; however, infants and young children may require a Q8-hr interval because of enhanced drug clearance. Headaches, dizziness, constipation, diarrhea, and drowsiness have occurred. Dosage adjustment is required in severe renal failure (see Chapter 31); prolonged QT interval has been reported very rarely in patients with renal impairment whose dosage had not been adjusted appropriately.
Rhabdomyolysis has been reported.
Shake oral suspension well prior to each use. Oral doses may be administered with or without food.

Lennox-Gastaut for child 2-14 yr (adjunctive therapy):
Start at 15 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ TID-QID; increase dosage by 15 mg/kg/24 hr increments
at weekly intervals up to a max. dose of 45 mg/kg/24 hr or 3600 mg/24 hr (whichever is less). See remarks for adjusting concurrent anticonvulsants.
Child =14 yr-adult:
Adjunctive therapy: Start at 1200 mg/24 hr PO ÷ TID-QID; increase dosage by 1200 mg/24 hr
at weekly intervals up to a max. dose of 3600 mg/day. See remarks for adjusting concurrent anticonvulsants.
Monotherapy (as initial therapy): Start at 1200 mg/24 hr PO ÷ TID-QID. Increase dose under close clinical supervision at 600 mg increments Q2 wk to 2400 mg/24 hr. Max. dose: 3600 mg/24 hr. Conversion to monotherapy: Start at 1200 mg/24 hr ÷ PO TID-QID for 2 wk; then increase to 2400 mg/24 hr for 1 wk. At wk 3, increase to 3600 mg/24 hr. Reduce dose of other anticonvulsants by
33% at the initiation of felbamate, then an additional 33% of original dose at wk 2 and continue to reduce other anticonvulsants as clinically indicated at wk 3 and beyond.
Drug should be prescribed under strict supervision by a specialist. Contraindicated in blood dyscrasias or hepatic dysfunction (prior or current), and hypersensitivity to meprobamate. Aplastic anemia and hepatic failure leading to death have been associated with drug. May cause headache, fatigue, anxiety, GI disturbances, gingival hyperplasia, increased liver enzymes, and bone marrow suppression. Suicidal behavior or ideation have been reported.

FELBAMATE continued
Obtain serum levels of concurrent anticonvulsants. Monitor liver enzymes, bilirubin, CBC with differential, platelets at baseline, and every 1-2 wk. Doses should be decreased by 50% in renally impaired patients.
When initiating adjunctive therapy (all ages), doses of other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are reduced by 20% to control plasma levels of concurrent phenytoin, valproic acid, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine. Further reductions of concomitant AED dosage may be necessary to minimize side effects caused by drug interactions.
When converting to monotherapy, reduce other AEDs by one-third at the start of felbamate therapy. Then after 2 wk and at the start of increasing the felbamate dosage, reduce other AEDs by an additional one-third. At wk 3, continue to reduce other AEDs as clinically indicated.
Carbamazepine levels may be decreased; however, phenytoin and valproic acid levels may be increased. Phenytoin and carbamazepine may increase felbamate clearance; valproic acid may decrease its clearance.
Doses can be administered with or without food.

Oral, breakthrough cancer pain for opioid-intolerant patients (see remarks):
Buccal tabs (=18 yr NOT previously using Actiq): Start with 100 mCg by placing tablet in the buccal cavity (above a rear molar, between the upper cheek and gum) and letting the tablet dissolve for 15-25 min. A second 100 mCg dose, if needed, may be administered 30 min after the start of the
first dose. If needed, increase dose initially in multiples of 100 mCg tablet when patients require >1
dose per breakthrough pain episode for several consecutive episodes. Must wait at least 4 hr before treating another episode with buccal tabs. If titration requires >400 mCg/dose, use 200 mCg tabs.
Lozenges (=16 yr): Start with 200 mCg by placing lozenge in the mouth between the cheek and
lower gum. If needed, may repeat dose 15 min after the completion of the first dose (30 min after start of prior dose). If therapy requires >1 lozenge per episode, consider increasing the dose to the next higher strength. Do not give more than 2 doses for each episode of breakthrough pain and reevaluate long-acting opioid therapy if patient requires >4 doses/24 hr. Must wait at least 4 hr before treating another episode with lozenges.


FENTANYL continued
Transdermal (see remarks): Safety has not been established in children <2 yr and should be adminis- tered in children =2 yr who are opioid tolerant. Use is contraindicated in acute or postoperative pain in opiate-naïve patients.
Opioid-tolerant child receiving at least 60 mg morphine equivalents/24 hr: Use 25 mCg/hr patch Q72 hr. Patch titration should not occur before 3 days of administration of the initial dose or more frequently than every 6 days thereafter.
See Chapter 6 for equianalgesic dosing and PCA dosing.
Intranasal route for acute and pre-procedure analgesia (use IV dosage form; see remarks):
=1 yr-adolescent: 1-2 mCg/kg/dose intranasally via an automizer (max. dose: 100 mCg/dose) Q1 hr PRN
Use with caution in bradycardia, respiratory depression, and increased intracranial pressure. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31). Fatalities and life-threatening respiratory depression have been reported with inappropriate use (overdoses, use in opioid-naïve patients, changing the patch too frequently, and exposing the patch to a heat source) of the transdermal route.
Highly lipophilic and may deposit into fat tissue. IV onset of action 1-2 min with peak effects in 10 min. IV duration of action 30-60 min. Give IV dose over 3-5 min. Rapid infusion may cause
respiratory depression and chest wall rigidity. Respiratory depression may persist beyond the period of analgesia. Transdermal onset of action 6-8 hr with a 72-hr duration of action. See Chapter 6 for pharmacodynamic information with transmucosal and transdermal routes.
Buccal tabs and oral lozenges are indicated only for the management of breakthrough cancer pain in patients who are already receiving and who are tolerant to opioid therapy. Buccal tabs (Fentora), transdermal patches (Duragesic), and lozenge (Actiq) dosage forms are available through a restricted distribution program (REMS) and are NOT bioequivalent (see package insert for conversion).
Intranasal route of administration for analgesia has an onset of action at 10-30 min. Pediatric stud- ies has demonstrated that the intranasal fentanyl is equivalent to and better than morphine (PO/ IV/IM) and equivalent to intravenous fentanyl for providing analgesia.
Fentanyl is a substrate for the CYP 450 3A4 enzyme. Be aware of medications that inhibit or induce this enzyme, for it may increase or decrease the effects of fentanyl, respectively.
Pregnancy category changes to "D" if drug is used for prolonged periods or in high doses at term.

Use with other medications known to prolong the QT interval and which are metabolized via the CYP 450 3A4 enzyme (e.g., erythromycin) are considered contraindicated. May cause nausea, headache, rash, vomiting, abdominal pain, hepatitis, cholestasis, and diarrhea. Neutropenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, exfoliative skin disorders (e.g., SJS, TEN, DRESS), and adrenal insufficiency (reversible) have been reported. Use with caution in hepatic or renal dysfunction and in patients with hypokalemia, proarrhythmic conditions, or advanced cardiac failure.
Inhibits CYP 450 2C9/10 and CYP 450 3A3/4 (weak inhibitor). May increase effects, toxicity, or levels of cyclosporine, midazolam, phenytoin, rifabutin, tacrolimus, theophylline, warfarin, oral hypoglycemics, and AZT. Rifampin increases fluconazole metabolism.
Consider using higher doses in morbidly obese patients. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).
Pregnancy category is "C" for single 150 mg use for vaginal candidiasis, but a Danish study reports a higher risk for miscarriages for during weeks 7-22 of gestation. Pregnancy category "D" is

Dosages of 75-100 mg/kg/24 hr have been used in neonates (preterm and term) for candidal
meningitis.
Child and adult (monitor serum concentrations): 50-150 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q6 hr PO
Monitor CBC, BUN, serum creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT. Common side effects: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, CNS disturbance, anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Use with caution in hepatic and renal impairment and in hematologic disorders. Use is contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy.
Therapeutic levels: 25-100 mg/L. Recommended serum sampling time at steady state: Obtain peak level 2-4 hr after oral dose following 4 days of continuous dosing. Peak levels of 40-60 mg/L have been recommended for systemic candidiasis. Maintain trough levels above 25 mg/L. Prolonged levels above 100 mg/L can increase risk for bone marrow suppression. Bone marrow suppression in immunosuppressed patients can be irreversible and fatal.
Flucytosine interferes with creatinine assay tests using the dry-slide enzymatic method (Kodak Ektachem analyzer). Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).



Adult: 0.05-0.2 mg/24 hr once daily PO
Contraindicated in CHF and systemic fungal infections. Has primarily mineralocorticoid activity. Use with caution in hypertension, edema, or renal dysfunction. May cause hypertension, hypokalemia, acne, rash, bruising, headaches, GI ulcers, and growth suppression.
Monitor BP and serum electrolytes. See Chapter 10 for steroid potency comparison.
Drug interactions: Drug's hypokalemic effects may induce digoxin toxicity; phenytoin and rifampin may increase fludrocortisone metabolism.

Child (limited data): 0.01 mg/kg (max. dose: 0.2 mg) Q1 min PRN to a max. total cumulative dose of 1 mg. As an alternative for repeat bolus doses, a continuous infusion of 0.005-0.01 mg/kg/hr have been used.
Adult: Initial dose: 0.2 mg over 30 sec, if needed, give 0.3 mg 30 sec later over 30 sec. Additional doses of 0.5 mg given over 30 sec Q1 min PRN up to a cumulative dose of 3 mg (usual cumulative dose: 1-3
mg). Patients with only partial response to 3 mg may require additional slow titration to a total of 5 mg.
Reversal of benzodiazepine sedation (IV):
Child: Initial dose: 0.01 mg/kg (max dose: 0.2 mg) given over 15 sec, if needed after 45 sec, 0.01 mg/kg (max. dose: 0.2 mg) Q1 min to a max. total cumulative dose of 0.05 mg/kg or 1 mg, whichever is lower. Usual total dose: 0.08-1 mg (average 0.65 mg).
Adult: Initial dose: 0.2 mg over 15 sec, if needed after 45 sec, give 0.2 mg Q1 min to a max. total cumulative dose of 1 mg. Doses may be repeated at 20 min interval (max. dose of 1 mg per 20 min interval) up to a max. dose of 3 mg in 1 hr.
Does not reverse narcotics. Onset of benzodiazepine reversal occurs in 1-3 min. Reversal effects of flumazenil (T1/2 approximately 1 hr) may wear off sooner than benzodiazepine effects. If patient does not respond after cumulative 1-3 mg dose, suspect agent other than benzodiazepines.
May precipitate seizures, especially in patients taking benzodiazepines for seizure control or in patients with tricyclic antidepressant overdose. Fear and panic attacks in patients with history of panic disorders have been reported.
Use with caution in liver dysfunction; flumazenil's clearance is significantly reduced. Use normal dose for initial dose and decrease the dosage and frequency for subsequent doses.

Bulimia:
Adolescent (PO; limited data): 20 mg QAM × 3 days, then 40 mg QAM × 3 days, then 60 mg QAM.
Adult: 60 mg QAM PO; it is recommended to titrate up to this dose over several days.
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder:
Adult: Start at 20 mg PO once daily continuously or intermittently (starting 14 days prior to the anticipated onset of menstruation through the first full day of menses and repeating with each new cycle) using the Sarafem product. Max. dose: 80 mg/24 hr. Systematic evaluation has shown that efficacy is maintained for periods of 6 mo at a dose of 20 mg/day. Reassess patients periodically to determine the need for continued treatment.
Contraindicated in patients taking MAO inhibitors (e.g., linezolid) due to possibility of seizures, hyperpyrexia, and coma. Use with caution in patients with angle-closure glaucoma, receiving diuretics, or with liver (reduce dose with cirrhosis) or renal impairment. May increase the effects of tricyclic antidepressants. May cause headache, insomnia, nervousness, drowsiness, GI disturbance, and weight loss. Increased bleeding diathesis with unaltered prothrombin time may occur with warfarin. Hyponatremia has been reported. Monitor for clinical worsening of depression and suicidal ideation/behavior following the initiation of therapy or after dose changes.
May displace other highly protein-bound drugs. Inhibits CYP 450 2C19, 2D6, and 3A3/4 drug metabo- lism isoenzymes, which may increase the effects or toxicity of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. For example, use with pimozide or thioridazine may increase the risk for prolonged cardiac QTc interval and is considered contraindicated. Use with serotonergic drugs (e.g., triptans, methylene blue) and drugs that impair serotonin metabolism (MAOIs) may increase the risk for serotonin syndrome. Carefully review the patients' medication profile for potential interactions.
Delayed-release capsule is currently indicated for depression and is dosed at 90 mg Q7 days. It is unknown if weekly dosing provides the same protection from relapse as does daily dosing.
Breastfeeding is not recommended by the manufacturer, as adverse events to nursing infants have been reported. Fluoxetine and metabolite are variable and are higher when compared with other SSRIs. Maternal use of SSRIs during pregnancy and postpartum may result in more difficult breast- feeding. Infants exposed to SSRIs during pregnancy may also have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.

Adult: one inhalation of 100 mCg fluticasone furoate + 25 mCg vilanterol OR 200 mCg fluticasone furoate + 25 mCg vilanterol once daily
Max. dose: one inhalation/24 hr for either dosage strength (25 mCg vilanterol/24 hr)
Contraindicated with hypersensitivity to milk proteins. See Fluticasone Preparations for remarks. Vilanterol is a long-acting ß2-adrenergic agonist with a faster onset and longer duration of action compared to salmeterol.
Hypersensitivity reactions, hyperglycemia, muscle spasms, and tremor have been reported.
Titrate to the lowest effective strength after asthma is adequately controlled. This dosage form's breath-activated device requires a minimum inspiratory flow rate of 60 mL/min for proper dose activation. Proper patient education including dosage administration technique is essential; see

Tabs: 25, 50, 100 mg
Extended-release capsules: 100, 150 mg
8-17 yr: Start at 25 mg PO QHS. Dose may be increased by 25 mg/24 hr Q7-14 days (slower titration at Q2-4 wk may be used for minimizing behavioral side effects). Total daily doses >50 mg/24 hr should be divided BID. Female patients may require lower dosages compared to males.
Max. dose: Child: 8-11 yr: 200 mg/24 hr; and child =12-17 yr: 300 mg/24 hr
Adult: Start at 50 mg PO QHS. Dose may be increased by 50 mg/24 hr Q4-7 days up to a max. dose of 300 mg/24 hr. Total daily doses >100 mg/24 hr should be divided BID with larger dose at bedtime.
Extended-release capsule (adult): Start at 100 mg PO QHS. Dose may be increased by 50 mg/24 hr Q7 days up to a max. dose of 300 mg/24 hr.
Contraindicated with coadministration of cisapride, pimozide, thioridazine, tizanidine, or MAO inhibitors. Use with caution in hepatic disease (dosage reduction may be necessary as drug is extensively metabolized by the liver) and in combination with serotonergic drugs (e.g., TCAs, triptans, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St.
John's Wort). Monitor for clinical worsening of depression and suicidal ideation/behavior following the initiation of therapy or after dose changes.
Major substrate for CYP 450 1A2 and 2D6. Poor metabolizers of CYP 450 2D6 should consider an initial dose reduction of 25%-50% and titrate to response or use an alternative medication not metabolized by this enzyme.
Inhibits CYP 450 1A2, 2C19, 2C9, 2D6, and 3A3/4, which may increase the effects or toxicity of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Dose-related use of thioridazine with fluvoxamine may cause prolongation of QT interval and serious arrhythmias. May increase warfarin plasma levels by 98% and prolong PT. May increase toxicity and/or levels of theophylline, caffeine, and tricyclic antide- pressants. Side effects include: headache, insomnia, somnolence, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, and dry mouth.
Titrate to lowest effective dose. Use a gradual taper when discontinuing therapy to prevent with- drawal symptoms.
Consider the benefits to potential risk for maternal use in breastfeeding. Maternal use during pregnancy and postpartum may result in breastfeeding difficulties.

FOSCARNET continued
May cause peripheral neuropathy, seizures, neutropenia, esophageal ulceration, hallucinations, GI disturbance, increased LFTs, hypertension, chest pain, ECG abnormalities (QT interval prolongation has been reported), coughing, dyspnea, bronchospasm, and renal failure (adequate hydration and avoiding nephrotoxic medications may reduce risk). Hypocalcemia (increased risk if given with pentamidine), hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia may also occur. Hypersensitivity reactions has been reported. Use with ciprofloxacin may increase risk for seizures.
Correction of dehydration and adequate hydration reduces the risk for nephrotoxicity. 10-20 mL/kg IV (max. dose: 1000 mL) of NS or D5W should be administer prior to the first dose and concurrently with subsequent doses. For lower foscarnet dosage regimens of 40-60 mg/kg, use 50% of the aforementioned hydration recommendations. Actual hydration may need to be reduced when clinically indicated. Oral hydration methods may also be considered in patients who are able to tolerate.
For peripheral line IV administration, the concentration must be diluted to 12 mg/mL in NS or D5W.





Injection: 50 mg phenytoin equivalent (75 mg fosphenytoin)/1 mL (2, 10 mL) 1 mg phenytoin equivalent provides 0.0037 mmol phosphate
All doses are expressed as phenytoin sodium equivalents (PE) (see remarks for dose administration information):
Neonate, child, and adolescent: See Phenytoin and use the conversion of 1 mg phenytoin = 1 mg PE
Adult:
Loading dose:
Status epilepticus: 20 mg PE/kg IV (max. dose: 1500 mg PE/dose)
Nonemergent loading: 10-20 mg PE/kg IV/IM
Nonemergent initial maintenance dose (initiated 12 hr after loading dose): 4-6 mg PE/kg/24 hr IV/ IM ÷ Q12-24 hr
All doses should be prescribed and dispensed in terms of mg phenytoin sodium equivalents (PE) to avoid medication errors. Safety in pediatrics has not been fully established.
Contraindicated in patients with history of phenytoin or other hydantoin hypersensitivity. Use
with caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and porphyria (consider amount of phos- phate delivered by fosphenytoin in patients with phosphate restrictions). Drug is also metabolized to liberate small amounts of formaldehyde, which is considered clinically insignificant with short-term use (e.g., 1 wk). Side effects: hypokalemia (with rapid IV administration), slurred speech, dizziness, ataxia, rash, exfoliative dermatitis (e.g., TEN, SJS; increased risk with patients with HLA-B*1502 allele), nystagmus, diplopia, and tinnitus. Angioedema has been reported. Increased unbound phenytoin concentrations may occur in patients with renal disease or hypoalbuminemia; measure "free" or "unbound" phenytoin levels in these patients.
Abrupt withdrawal may cause status epilepticus. BP and ECG monitoring should be present during IV loading dose administration. Max. IV infusion rate: 2 mg PE/kg/min up to a max. of 150 mg PE/
min. Administer IM via 1 or 2 injection sites and IM route is not recommended in status epilepticus.
Therapeutic levels: 10-20 mg/L (free and bound phenytoin) OR 1-2 mg/L (free only). Recommended peak serum sampling times: 4 hr following an IM dose or 2 hr following an IV dose.
See Phenytoin remarks for drug interactions and additional side effects. Drug is more safely adminis- tered via peripheral IV than phenytoin.



Tabs: 20, 40, 80 mg

Infant and child: 1-2 mg/kg/dose Q6-12 hr; max. dose: 6 mg/kg/dose not to exceed 200 mg/dose
Adult: 20-40 mg/24 hr ÷ Q6-12 hr; max. dose: 200 mg/dose
PO:
Neonate: Bioavailability by this route is poor; doses of 1-3 mg/kg/dose once daily to BID have been used.
Infant and child: Start at 2 mg/kg/dose; may increase by 1-2 mg/kg/dose no sooner than 6-8 hr following the previous dose. Max. dose: 6 mg/kg/dose. Dosages have ranged from 1-6 mg/kg/dose Q12-24 hr.
Adult: 20-80 mg/dose Q6-12 hr; max. dose: 600 mg/24 hr
Continuous IV infusion:
Infant and child: 0.1 mg/kg IV bolus followed by 0.05-0.4 mg/kg/hr infusion and titrate to effect
Adult: 40-100 mg IV bolus followed by 10-40 mg/hr infusion and titrate to effect
Contraindicated in anuria and hepatic coma. Use with caution in hepatic disease (hepatic encephalopathy has been reported); cirrhotic patients may require higher than usual doses. Ototoxicity may occur in presence of renal disease (especially when used with aminoglycosides and other nephrotoxic drugs), with rapid IV injection (do not infuse >4 mg/min in adults), or with hypoproteinemia. May cause hypokalemia, alkalosis, dehydration, hyperuricemia, and increased calcium excretion. Rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis have been reported. Prolonged use in premature infants and in children <4 yr may result in nephrocalcinosis. May increase risk for PDA in premature infants during the first week of life.
Furosemide-resistant edema in pediatric patients may benefit with the addition of metolazone. Some of these patients may have an exaggerated response leading to hypovolemia, tachycardia, and orthostatic hypotension requiring fluid replacement. Severe hypokalemia has been reported with a tendency for diuresis persisting for up to 24 hr after discontinuing metolazone, prolonged use of laxatives, or concomitant use of corticosteroids, ACTH, and large amounts of licorice.
High doses of furosemide may inhibit binding of thyroid hormones to carrier proteins and result in transient increase in free thyroid hormones followed by an overall decrease in total thyroid hormone levels.
Max. rate of intermittent IV dose: 0.5 mg/kg/min. For patients receiving ECMO, do not administer IV doses directly into the ECMO circuit as the medication is absorbed in the circuit, which may result in diminished effects and the need for higher doses.
Pregnancy category changes to "D" if used in pregnancy-induced hypertension.

Transdermal patch (see remarks):
Prophylaxis for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (adult): Apply 1 patch 24-48 hr prior to chemotherapy. Patch removal at a minimum of 24 hr after completion of chemotherapy. Patch may be worn up to 7 days, depending on the chemotherapy regimen duration.
Use with caution in liver disease and preexisting cardiac conduction disorders and arrhythmias. May cause hypertension, hypotension, arrhythmias, agitation, and insomnia. Inducers or inhibitors of the CYP 450 3A3/4 drug metabolizing enzymes may increase or decrease, respectively, the drug's clearance. QT prolongation has been reported.
Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting has not been established due to lack of efficacy and QT prolongation in a prospective multicenter, randomized double blinded trial in 157 patients aged 2-16 yr.
Avoid external heat sources (e.g., heating pads) on and around the transdermal patch dosage form as heat may increase the rate of drug release. Application site reactions of pain, pruritus, rash, irritation, vesicles, and discoloration has been reported with transdermal patch use.

GUANFACINE continued
Use with caution in patients at risk for hypotension, bradycardia, heart block, and syncope. A dose-dependent hypotension and bradycardia may occur. Somnolence, fatigue, insomnia, dizziness, and abdominal pain are common side effects. Orthostatic hypotension, hallucinations, syncope, and erectile dysfunction have been reported.
Drug is a substrate for CYP 450 3A4. See dosing section for dosage adjustment with inhibitors and inducers.
Do not abruptly discontinue therapy (may cause rebound hypertension); taper of no more than 1 mg Q3-7 days has been recommended. Dose reductions may be required with clinically significant renal or hepatic impairment. When converting from an immediate-release tab to the extended- release tab, do not covert on a mg per mg basis (due to differences in pharmacokinetic profiles) but discontinue the immediate release and titrate with the extended-release product using the recommended dosing schedules.

Tourette's syndrome: 0.5-2 mg/dose BID-TID PO; 3-5 mg/dose BID-TID PO may be used for severe symptoms
Contraindicated in severe toxic CNS depression, comas, Parkinson disease, and dementia Lewy bodies. Use with caution in patients with cardiac disease (risk of hypotension), renal or hepatic dysfunction, thyrotoxicosis, and in patients with epilepsy since the drug lowers the seizure threshold. Extrapyramidal symptoms, drowsiness, headache, tachycardia, ECG changes, nausea, and vomiting can occur. Higher than recommended doses are associated with a higher risk of QT-prolongation and torsades de pointes. Leukopenia/neutropenia, including agranulocytosis and rhabdomyolysis (IM route), and transient dyskinetic signs (following abrupt withdrawal from maintenance therapies) have been reported.
Continued


HALOPERIDOL continued
Drug is metabolized by CYP 450 1A2, 2D6, and 3A3/4 isoenzymes. May also inhibit CYP 450 2D6 and 3A3/4 isoenzymes. Serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine) may increase levels and effects of haloperidol. Carbamazepine and phenobarbital may decrease levels and effects of haloperidol. Monitor for encephalopathic syndrome when used in combination with lithium.
For poor metabolizers of CYP 450 2D6, consider a 50% reduction of initial dose and titrate to response, OR use an alternative medication not metabolized by this enzyme system.
Acutely aggravated patients may require doses as often as Q60 min. Decanoate salt is given every 3-4 wk in doses that are 10-15 times the individual patient's stabilized oral dose.

aDo not give loading dose for patients with stroke or significant bleeding risk and obtain aPPT 4 hr after loading dose.

DVT or PE prophylaxis:
Adult: 5000 U/dose SC Q8-12 hr until ambulatory
Heparin flush (doses should be less than heparinizing dose):
Younger child: lower doses should be used to avoid systemic heparinization.
Older child and adult:
Peripheral IV: 1-2 mL of 10 U/mL solution Q4 hr
Central lines: 2-3 mL of 100 U/mL solution Q24 hr
TPN (central line) and arterial line: add heparin to make final concentration of 0.5-1 U/mL.
Contraindicated in active major bleeding, known or suspected HIT, and concurrent epidural therapy. Use with caution if platelets <50,000/mm3. Avoid IM injections and other medications affecting platelet function (e.g., NSAIDs and ASA). Toxicities include bleeding, allergy, alopecia, and thrombocytopenia.
Adjust dose with one of the following laboratory goals:
Unfractionated heparin (UFH) anti-Xa level: 0.3-0.7 units/mL
aPTT level (reagent specific to reflect anti-Xa level of 0.3-0.7 units/mL): 50-80 sec.

H
HEPARIN SODIUM continued
These laboratory measurements are best measured 4-6 hr after initiation or changes in infusion rate. Do not collect blood levels from the heparinized line or same extremity as site of heparin infusion. If unfractionated heparin anti-Xa or aPTT levels are not available, a ratio of aPPT 1.5-2.5 times control value has been used in the past. Unfractionated heparin anti-Xa level is NOT THE SAME as low molecular weight heparin anti-Xa (used for monitoring low molecular weight heparin products such as enoxaparin).
Use with IV nitroglycerin may decrease the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) with subsequent rebound upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) and NSAIDs may increase heparin's anticoagulant effects and bleeding risk.
Use preservative-free heparin in neonates. Note: heparin flush doses may alter aPTT in small patients; consider using more dilute heparin in these cases.
Use actual body weight when dosing obese patients. Due to recent regulatory changes to the manu- facturing process, heparin products may exhibit decreased potency.
Antidote: Protamine sulfate (1 mg per 100 U heparin in previous 4 hr). For low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), see Enoxaparin.

For IV use, give slowly over 30-60 min at a concentration =5 mg/mL to reduce risk for nausea (lowering the rate may reduce severity). Adverse effects: thrombophlebitis, pruritus, urticaria, GI symptoms, seizures, dizziness, hypotension, elevated LFTs, blood dyscrasias, and penicillin allergy. Greater risk for seizures may occur with CNS infections, concomitant use with ganciclovir, higher doses, and renal impairment. CSF penetration is variable but best with inflamed meninges. Not recommended in CNS infections for neonates due to cilastatin accumulation and seizure risk.
Do not administer with probenecid (increases imipenem/cilastatin levels) and ganciclovir (increased risk for seizures). May significantly reduce valproic acid levels.
Adjust dose in renal insufficiency (see Chapter 31).

IMIPRAMINE continued
Contraindicated in narrow-angle glaucoma and patients who used MAO inhibitors within 14 days. See Chapter 3 for management of toxic ingestion. Monitor for clinical worsening of depression and suicidal ideation/behavior following the initiation of therapy or after dose changes. Use with caution in renal or hepatic impairment. Side effects include sedation, urinary retention, constipation, dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness, and arrhythmia. QHS dosing during first weeks of therapy will reduce sedation. Monitor ECG, BP, CBC at start of therapy and with dose changes. Tricyclics may cause mania. False-positive test for urine PCP screen may occur.
Therapeutic reference range for depression (sum of imipramine and desipramine) =
150-250 ng/mL. Levels >1000 ng/mL are toxic; however, toxicity may occur at >300 ng/mL.
Recommended serum sampling times at steady-state: Obtain trough level within 30 min prior to the next scheduled dose after 5-7 days of continuous therapy.
Imipramine is a major substrate for CYP 450 2C19 and 2D6. See the remarks in amitriptyline for pharmacogenomic dosing considerations. Carbamazepine may reduce imipramine levels, and cimetidine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, labetalol, quinidine may increase imipramine levels.
Onset of antidepressant effects: 1-3 wk. Do not discontinue abruptly in patients receiving long-term high-dose therapy.
Pregnancy category has not been officially assigned by the FDA as congenital abnormalities have been reported in humans with the causal relationship not being established.

For severe hypogammaglobulinemia (<100 mg/dL), patients may benefit with a loading dose of 400 mg/kg/dose once daily × 2, followed by 400-500 mg/kg/dose Q4 wk.
Pediatric HIV with IgG <400 mg/dL: See replacement therapy for antibody-deficient disorder from above.
Bone marrow transplantation (may decrease risk for infection and death but not acute graft- versus-host disease): Start at 400-500 mg/kg/dose to maintain IgG levels =400 mg/dL resulting in dosage intervals ranging from once weekly to Q3-4 wk.
Measles, postexposure prophylaxis for individuals with primary humoral immunodeficiency or without evidence of measles immunity (6-16 yr): 400 mg/kg/dose as soon as possible and within 6 days after exposure.
General guidelines for administration (see package insert of specific products):
IV: Begin infusion at 0.01 mL/kg/min, double rate every 15-30 min, up to max. of 0.08 mL/kg/min. If adverse reactions occur, stop infusion until side effects subside and may restart at rate that was previously tolerated.
Subcutaneous (SC) preparations:
Converting to SC route from previous IV dosage for patients receiving IV immune globulin (IVIG) infusions at regular intervals for at least 3 mo (=2 yr):
Initial weekly dose (start 1 wk after last IV dose):

SC ProductDose Calculation (mg)Dose Calculation (mL)HizentraDose (g) = 1.37 × Previous IVIG dose in grams
(g) ÷ number of weeks between IVIG dosesmL = multiply dose (g) by 5CutaquigDose (g) = 1.40 × Previous IVIG dose in grams
(g) ÷ number of weeks between IVIG dosesmL = multiply dose (g) by 6CuvitruDose (g) = 1.30 × Previous IVIG dose in grams
(g) ÷ number of weeks between IVIG dosesmL = multiply dose (g) by 5Adjust dose over time by clinical response and serum IgG trough levels. Obtain a previous trough level from IVIG therapy prior to SC conversion and repeat trough level 2-3 mo after initiating the SC route. A goal trough with the SC route of ~290 mg/dL higher than a trough with the IV route has
been recommended.
Measles, postexposure prophylaxis for high-risk patients: Hizentra: 0.2 g/kg/dose SC Q7 days × 2, or 0.4 g/kg/dose SC × 1

Use with caution in patients with increased risk of thrombosis (e.g., hypercoagulable states, prolonged immobilization, in-dwelling catheters, estrogen use, thrombosis history, cardiovascular risks, and hyperviscosity) or hemolysis (e.g., non-O blood type, associated inflammatory conditions, and receiving high cumulative doses of immune globulins over several days).
May cause flushing, chills, fever, headache, and hypotension. Hypersensitivity reaction may occur when IV form is administered rapidly. Maltose-containing products may cause an osmotic diuresis. May cause anaphylaxis in lgA-deficient patients due to varied amounts of lgA. Some products are lgA depleted; consult a pharmacist.
To decrease risk of renal dysfunction, including acute renal failure, IV preparations containing sucrose should not be infused at a rate such that the amount of sucrose exceeds 3 mg/kg/min.
SC route provides higher serum trough levels, lower rate of adverse reactions, and shorter administra- tion time when compared with the IV route. Use of adjusted body weight [ABW = Ideal Body Weight +
  0.5 (Actual Body Weight - Ideal Body Weight] for dosing in obese patients has been recommended. Delay immunizations after immune globulin administration (see latest AAP Red Book for details).

IV contrast for CT scans: Use Visipaque 320 mg/mL, check for contraindications, and all patients should be encouraged to drink extra fluids for 8 hrs after the exam as allowed. eGFR =60 mL/min/1.73 m2: 2 mL/kg/dose
eGFR 30-60 mL/min/1.73 m2: Administered a reduced dose with IV fluids + acetylcysteine to reduce risk for nephropathy
eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2: Avoid use unless life-threatening situation where benefits outweigh the risk
PO contrast for CT scans: see Iohexol
Contraindicated in children with prolonged fasting and the administration of a laxative before use. Avoid use via intrathecal route (serious life-threatening reactions may occur) and previous hypersensitivity reactions with contrast agents. Use with caution in asthma, hay fever, food allergy, congestive heart failure, severe liver or renal impairment, diabetic nephropathy, multiple myeloma, pheochromocytoma, hyperthyroidism, and sickle cell disease.
Common side effects include general discomfort, sensations of warmth, and pain. Cardiac arrest, dysrhythmia, heart failure, shock, severe dermatological reactions (e.g., SJS, TEN), sickle cell crisis, thromboembolic disorder, acute kidney injury, and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported.
Children at higher risk for adverse events with contrast medium administration may include those having asthma, sensitivity to medication and/or allergens, congestive heart failure, serum creati- nine >1.5 mg/dL, or those aged <12 mo.
Avoid use with metformin as lactic acidosis and acute renal failure may occur. Postpone IV admin- istration in patients who have recently received an oral cholecystographic contrast agent as renal toxicity may occur.
Visipaque 320 mg/mL has an osmolality of 290 mOsmol/kg than Omnipaque 350 mg/mL (884 mOsmol/kg) for a lower risk of contrast nephropathy. See product information for intravenous and intra-arterial administration guidelines.

IV contrast for CT scans: see Iodixanol
Avoid use with history of severe cutaneous reactions to iohexol. Use with caution in dehydration, previous allergic reaction to a contrast medium, iodine sensitivity, asthma, hay fever, food allergy, congestive heart failure, severe liver or renal impairment, diabetic nephropathy, multiple myeloma, pheochromocytoma, hyperthyroidism, and sickle cell disease. Allergic reactions, arrhythmias, hypothyroidism, transient thyroid suppression, and nephrotoxicity have been reported.
Children at higher risk for adverse events with contrast medium administration may include those having asthma, sensitivity to medication and/or allergens, congestive heart failure, serum creati- nine >1.5 mg/dL, or those aged <12 mo.
Use NOT recommended with drugs that lower seizure threshold (e.g., phenothiazines), amiodarone (increased risk of cardiotoxicity), and metformin (lactic acidosis and acute renal failure).
Many other uses exist, see package insert for additional information. Iohexol is particularly useful when barium sulfate is contraindicated in patients with suspected bowel perforation or those where aspiration of contrast medium is of concern. Oral dose is poorly absorbed from the normal GI tract (0.1%-0.5%); absorption increases with bowel perforation or bowel obstruction.
Concentrations 302-755 mg iohexol/mL have osmolalities from 1.1 to 3 times that of plasma (285 mOsm/kg) and CSF (301 mOsm/kg) and may be hypertonic.

Contraindicated in atropine hypersensitivity. Use with caution in narrow-angle glaucoma or bladder neck obstruction, though ipratropium has fewer anticholinergic systemic effects than atropine. May cause anxiety, dizziness, headache, GI discomfort, and cough with inhaler or nebulized use. Epistaxis, nasal congestion, and dry mouth/throat have been reported with the nasal spray. Reversible anisocoria may occur with unintentional aerosolization of drug to the eyes, particularly with mask nebulizers. Proven efficacy of nebulized solution in pediatrics is currently limited to reactive airway disease management in the emergency room and intensive care unit areas.
Current aerosol inhaler product does not contain soy products. Combination ipratropium and albuterol products are currently approved for use only in adults and has not been formally studied in children. See albuterol for additional remarks if using the combination product.
Bronchodilation onset of action is 1-3 min with peak effects within 1.5-2 hr and duration of action of 4-6 hr.
Shake inhaler well prior to use with spacer. Nebulized solution may be mixed with albuterol (or use the combination product).

IV administration: May administer undiluted over 2-5 min. For an infusion, dilute each 100 mg with a max. of 100 mL NS and infuse over at least 15 min.


IRON-INJECTABLE PREPARATIONS continued
Oral therapy with iron salts is preferred, injectable routes are painful. Gluconate and sucrose salts may be better tolerated than iron dextran. Adverse effects include hypotension, GI disturbances, fever, rash, myalgia, arthralgias, cramps, and headaches. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported for iron dextran and sucrose products; use of test dose prior to first therapeutic dose is recommended.
IM administration is only possible with iron dextran salt. Follow infusion recommendations for specific product. Monitor vital signs during IV infusion. TIBC levels may not be meaningful within 3 wk after dosing.
Efficacy and safety of iron sucrose for maintenance therapy has been evaluated in children 2 yr and older with CKD and receiving erythropoietin therapy. Common side effects include headache, respiratory tract viral infection, peritonitis, vomiting, pyrexia, dizziness, and cough.

For INH-resistant TB: Discuss with Health Department or consult ID specialist.
Should not be used alone for treatment. Contraindicated in acute liver disease and previous isoniazid-associated hepatitis. Peripheral neuropathy, optic neuritis, seizures, encephalopathy, psychosis, and hepatic side effects may occur with higher doses, especially in combination with rifampin. Severe liver injury has been reported in children and adults treated for latent TB. Follow LFTs monthly. Pancreatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and DRESS have been reported. May cause false-positive urine glucose test.
Supplemental pyridoxine (1-2 mg/kg/24 hr) is recommended for prevention of neurological side effects.


ISONIAZID continued
Inhibits CYP 450 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 3A3/4 microsomal enzymes; decrease dose of carbamazepine, diazepam, phenytoin, and prednisone. Prednisone may decrease isoniazid's effects. Also a sub- strate and inducer of CYP 450 2E1 and may potentiate acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. Avoid daily alcohol use to reduce risk for isoniazid-induced hepatitis.
May be given IM (same as oral doses) when oral therapy is not possible. Administer oral doses
1 hr prior to and 2 hr after meals. Aluminum salts may decrease absorption. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).


Injection: 0.2 mg/mL (1, 5 mL); preparations may be preservative free or contain disodium EDTA

Neonate-child: 0.05-2 mCg/kg/min; start at minimum dose and increase every 5-10 min
by 0.1 mCg/kg/min until desired effect or onset of toxicity; max. dose: 2 mCg/kg/min.
Adult: 2-20 mCg/min; titrate to desired effect.
Use with caution in diabetes, hyperthyroidism, renal disease, CHF, ischemia, or aortic stenosis. May cause flushing, ventricular arrhythmias, profound hypotension, anxiety, and myocardial ischemia. Monitor heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. Not for treatment of asystole or for use in cardiac arrests, unless bradycardia is due to heart block.
Continuous infusion for bronchodilatation must be gradually tapered over a 24-48 hr period to prevent rebound bronchospasm. Tolerance may occur with prolonged use. Clinical deterioration, myocardial necrosis, congestive heart failure, and death have been reported with continuous infu- sion use in refractory asthmatic children.

cheilitis, bone pain, muscle aches, skeletal changes, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, elevated ESR, mental depression, aggressive/violent behavior, and psychosis. Serious skin reactions (e.g., Stevens Johnson syndrome, TEN) have been reported.
Elevation of liver enzymes may occur during treatment; a dosage reduction or continued treatment may result in normalization. Discontinue use if liver enzymes do not normalize or if hepatitis is suspected.
To avoid additive toxic effects, do not take vitamin A concomitantly. Increases clearance of carbam- azepine. Hormonal birth control (oral, injectable, and implantable) failures have been reported with concurrent use. Monitor CBC, ESR, triglycerides, and LFTs.
Prescribers, site pharmacists, patients, and wholesalers must register with the iPLEDGE system (a risk minimization program) at www.ipledgeprogram.com or 1-866-495-0654 before doses are dispensed. Prescriptions may not be written for more than a 1-mo supply.

ITRACONAZOLE continued
Oral solution and capsule dosage form should NOT be used interchangeably; oral solution is more bioavailable. Only the oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Contraindicated in CHF and certain interacting drugs (see below). Use with caution in hepatic and/or renal impairment, cardiac dysrhythmias, and azole hypersensitivity. May cause GI symptoms, headaches, rash, liver enzyme elevation, hepatitis, and hypokalemia. Double/blurred vision, dizziness, and tremor have been reported.
Like ketoconazole, it inhibits the activity of the CYP-450 3A4 drug metabolizing isoenzyme. Thus, the coadministration of cisapride, dofetilide, felodipine, methadone, nisoldipine, pimozide, quinidine, triazolam, lovastatin, simvastatin, ergot derivatives, and oral midazolam is contraindicated. May increase systemic hormone concentrations of oral contraceptives. See remarks in Ketoconazole for additional drug interaction information.
Steady-state serum concentrations of >0.25 mg/L itraconazole and >1 mg/L hydroxyitraconazole (metabolite) have been recommended. Recommended serum sampling time at steady state: any time after 2 wk after continuous dosing. Itraconazole has a 34-42-hour T1/2.
Administer oral solution on an empty stomach but administer capsules with food. Oral capsule bioavailability has been shown to be reduced in immunocompromised patients. Achlorhydria reduces absorption of the drug. Do not use oral liquid dosage form in patients with GFR <30 mL/ min because of hydroxypropyl-ß-cyclodextrin excipient has reduced clearance with renal failure.

IVACAFTOR continued
Works as a CFTR potentiator on class 3 CFTR mutations. Originally indicated for G551D CFTR mutation but has since been approved for many other mutations; see product information for list of approved mutations.
Common side effects include rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, dizziness, headache, nasal congestion, pharyngitis, and URIs. Increased liver enzymes and cataracts may occur; monitor base- line AST/ALT and ocular exam. Repeat AST/ALT every 3 months for the first year followed by annual assessments. Repeat ocular exams annually. May cause a false-positive urine drug screen test for cannabinoids. Use with caution in patients with CrCl =30 mL/min; has not been studied.
Ivacaftor is CYP 450 3A substrate; see dose modification table in the dosing section. Use with strong CYP 450 3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, St. John's wort) is not recom- mended. Always evaluate potential drug-drug interactions; see https://www.kalydecohcp.com/ drug-interactions. Avoid food or drink containing grapefruit or Seville oranges.
Administer all doses with high-fat foods to assure absorption. Oral granules can be mixed with 5 mL of soft foods or liquids such as puréed fruits or vegetables, yogurt, applesauce, water, breast milk, infant formula, milk, or juice. Once mixed, it should be consumed within an hour. If a dose (all dosage forms) is missed within 6 hr of a scheduled dose, administer a dose immediately. However, if the missed dose is >6 hr, skip that dose and resume therapy at the next scheduled dose. Never take a double dose for a missed dose.

The systemic dosage form should NOT be first-line treatment for any fungal infection due to concerns of hepatotoxicity and adrenal gland effects (per the FDA).
Monitor LFTs in long-term use and adrenal function for patients at risk. Drugs that decrease gastric acidity will decrease absorption. May cause nausea, vomiting, rash, headache, pruritus, and fever. Hepatotoxicity (including fatal cases) has been reported; use with hepatic impairment is contraindicated. High doses may decrease adrenocortical function and serum testosterone levels. Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis), has been reported with all dosage forms.
Safety and efficacy with topical use in seborrheic dermatitis for patients >12 yr of age has been established. Avoid topical use on breast or nipples in nursing mothers.

KETAMINE continued
Inhibits CYP 450 3A4. Contraindicated when used with cisapride, disopyramide, methadone, mefloquine, quinidine, terfenadine, pimozide, or any drug that can prolong the QT interval (because of risk for cardiac arrhythmias), and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (e.g., simvastatin, and lov- astatin). Excessive sedation and prolonged hypnotic effects with triazolam use (also contraindi- cated). May increase levels/effects of phenytoin, digoxin, cyclosporine, corticosteroids, nevirapine, protease inhibitors, and warfarin. Achlorhydria, phenobarbital, rifampin, isoniazid, H2 blockers, antacids, and omeprazole can decrease levels of oral ketoconazole.
Administering oral doses with food or acidic beverages and 2 hr prior to antacids will increase absorption. For topical products, avoid contact with eyes and other mucous membranes.
To use shampoo, wet hair and scalp with water, apply sufficient amount to scalp and gently massage for about 1 min. Rinse hair thoroughly, reapply shampoo and leave on the scalp for an additional
3 min, and rinse.

Converting from other single antiepileptic drug (AED) to lacosamide monotherapy: administer lacos- amide in combination with the established single AED for at least 3 days before tapering. Gradually withdrawing the concomitant AED over 6 wk is recommended.
IV use: Use same dose when converting from PO to IV and vice versa. IV use should be considered for short-term use and has not been studied in pediatrics.
Use with caution with known cardiac conduction problems (e.g., second-degree AV block), severe cardiac disease (e.g., MI or heart failure), concomitant use with drugs known to prolong PR interval, and renal (see Chapter 31) and hepatic impairment. Lacosamide undergoes 95% renal excretion; a reduction of 25% of the maximum dosage is recommended for adult and pediatric patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/ min and ESRD), or with mild/moderate hepatic impairment. Use is not recommended in severe hepatic impairment. Dose reduction may be also necessary with concurrent strong inhibitor of CYP 450 3A4 or 2C9 medication. Patients with mild/moderate hepatic impairment should be observed closely during dose titration. Oral bioavailability is approximately 100%.
Most common side effects in adults include diplopia, headache, dizziness, and nausea. Somnolence and irritability were frequently reported in pediatric studies. Patients should be advised of potential dizziness, ataxia, and syncope with use. Multiorgan hypersensitiv- ity reactions (including DRESS, affecting the skin, kidney and liver), worsening of seizures,
agranulocytosis, and euphoria (high doses) have been reported. As with other AEDs, monitor for suicidal behavior and ideation.
Oral doses may be administered with or without food. Swallow tablets whole; do not cut tablets. IV doses should be administered over 30-60 min. Do not abruptly withdraw therapy; gradually taper to prevent potential seizures.

18 and adult: 100 mg/dose PO once daily
See aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines for remarks for use in HIV. Oral tablet dosage form is preferred over oral solution for children =14 kg treated for HIV because subjects in the
ARROW clinical trial receiving oral solution had lower rates of HIV viral suppression, lower plasma lamivudine exposure, and developed viral resistance more frequently.
May cause headache, fatigue, GI disturbances, rash, and myalgia/arthralgia. Lactic acidosis, severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, post-treatment exacerbations of hepatitis B and ALT elevations, pancreatitis, and emergence of resistant viral strains have been reported. Treatment should be suspended in any patient developing clinical or laboratory signs of lactic acidosis or hepatotoxicity.


LAMIVUDINE continued
Avoid use with sorbitol-containing medicines, as sorbitol reduces lamivudine exposure. Concomitant use with co-trimoxazole (TMP/SMX) may result in increased lamivudine levels.
Use Epivir-HBV product for chronic hepatitis B indication only. Safety and effectiveness beyond 1 yr have not been determined. If serum HBV DNA remains detectable after 24 wk of lamivudine
monotherapy, consider switching to an alternative therapy. Patients with both HIV and hepatitis B should use the higher HIV doses along with an appropriate combination regimen.
May be administered with food. Adjust dose in renal impairment (see Chapter 31).

Enzyme-inducing AEDs include carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital. Stevens- Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and other potentially life-threatening rashes have been reported in children (0.3%-0.8%) and adults (0.08%-0.3%) for adjunctive therapy in seizures. Reported rates for adults treated for bipolar/mood disorders as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy are 0.08% and 0.13%, respectively. May cause fatigue, drowsiness, ataxia, rash (especially with valproic acid), headache, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Diplopia, nystagmus, aseptic meningitis, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, aggression, and alopecia have also been reported. False-positive test for urine phencyclidine (PCP) screen may occur.
Use during the first 3 mo of pregnancy may result in a higher chance for cleft lip or cleft palate in the newborn. Suicidal behavior or ideation have been reported.
If converting from immediate-release to extended-release dosage form, initial dose of extended- release should match the total daily dose of the immediate-release dosage and be administered once daily. Adjust dose as needed with the recommended dosage guidelines.
Reduce maintenance dose in renal failure. Reduce all doses (initial, escalation, and maintenance) in liver dysfunction defined by the Child-Pugh grading system as follows:
Grade B: moderate dysfunction, decrease dose by ~50%
Grade C: severe dysfunction, decrease dose by ~75%
Withdrawal symptoms may occur if discontinued suddenly. A stepwise dose reduction over =2 wk (~50% per week) is recommended unless safety concerns require a more rapid withdrawal.
Lamotrigine is metabolized by uridine 5'- diphospho-glucuronyl transferases (UGT). Strong and moderate inducers of CYP 450 3A4 are known to induce UGT to increase lamotrigine clearance. Acetaminophen, carbamazepine, oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol), pheno- barbital, primidone, phenytoin, and rifampin may decrease levels of lamotrigine. Valproic acid may increase levels. False positive urine drug screen for phencyclidine (PCP) has been reported.
Safety and efficacy for maintenance therapy for bipolar disorder in 10-17 yr olds were not established in a RCT in 301 subjects.

Common side effects include GI discomfort, headache, fatigue, rash, and taste perversion. Hypersensitivity reactions may result in anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, interstitial nephritis, and urticaria. Prolonged use may result in vitamin B{12} deficiency (=2 yr) or hypomagnesemia (>1 yr). Microscopic colitis resulting in watery diarrhea has been reported, and switching to an alternative proton-pump inhibitor may be beneficial in resolving diarrhea. Increased risk for fundic gland polys has been associated with long- term use >1 yr.
Drug is a substrate for CYP 450 2C19 and 3A3/4. Ultrarapid metabolizers of CYP 450 2C19 may experience reduced efficacy and may require a 4-fold higher dosage. Lansoprazole may decrease levels of itraconazole, ketoconazole, iron salts, mycophenolate, nelfinavir, and ampicillin esters; and increase the levels/effects of methotrexate, tacrolimus and warfarin. Theophylline clearance may be enhanced. Reduce dose in severe hepatic impairment. May be used in combination with clarithromycin and amoxicillin for H. pylori infections.
A multicenter, double blind, parallel-group study in infants (1 mo-1 yr) with GERD was no more
effective than placebo.
Administer all oral doses before meals and 30 min prior to sucralfate. Do not crush or chew the granules (all dosage forms). Capsule may be opened and intact granules may be administered in an acidic beverage or food (e.g., apple or cranberry juice, apple sauce). Do not break or cut the orally disintegrating tablets. Use of oral disintegrating tablets dissolved in water has been reported to clog and block oral syringes and feeding tubes (gastric and jejunostomy). For IV use, use a 1.2 micron in-line filter.

Refractory status epilepticus: (limited data):
Infant, child, and adolescent: 20 mg/kg (max. dose: 1500 mg/dose) IV over 15 min × 1, then start maintenance therapy based on clinical response and seizure type.
Do not abruptly withdraw therapy, to reduce risk for seizures. Use with caution in renal impairment (reduce dose; see Chapter 31) , hemodialysis, and neuropsychiatric conditions.
May cause loss of appetite, vomiting, dizziness, headaches, somnolence, agitation, depression, and mood swings. Drowsiness, fatigue, nervousness, and aggressive behavior have been reported in children. Nonpsychotic behavioral symptoms reported in children are approximately 3 times greater than in adults (37.6% vs. 13.3%). Suicidal behavior or ideation, serious dermatological reactions (e.g., Stevens Johnson and TEN), hematologic abnormalities (e.g., anemia, leukopenia), hyponatre- mia, and hypertension have been reported. Levetiracetam may decrease carbamazepine's effects. Ginkgo may decrease levetiracetam's effects.
Drug has excellent PO absorption. For IV use, use similar immediate-release PO dosages only when the oral route of administration is not feasible. Extended-release tablet is designed for once-daily administration at similar daily dosage of the immediate-release forms (e.g., 1000 mg once daily of the extended release tablet is equivalent to 500 mg BID of the immediate release tablet).
Disintegrating tabs (Spritam) may be administered by allowing the tablet to disintegrate in the mouth when taken with a sip of liquid or made into a suspension (see package insert); do not swallow this dosage form whole.

Contraindicated in hypersensitivity to other quinolones. Avoid in patients with history of QTc prolongation or taking QTc prolonging drugs, and excessive sunlight exposure.
Use with caution in diabetes, seizures, myasthenia gravis, children <18 yr, and renal impairment (adjust dose, see Chapter 31). May cause GI disturbances, headache, and blurred vision with the ophthalmic solution. Musculoskeletal disorders (e.g., arthralgia, arthritis, tendinopathy, and gait abnormality) may occur. Peripheral neuropathy and uveitis have been reported. Safety in pediatric patients treated more than 14 days has not been evaluated. Like other quinolones, tendon rupture can occur during or after therapy (risk increases with concurrent corticosteroids). Psychiatric adverse events, increased intracranial pressure, seizures, and blood glucose disturbances have been reported. Use with NSAIDs may increase risk of CNS stimulation and seizures.
Infuse IV over 1-1.5 hr; avoid IV push or rapid infusion because of risk of hypotension. Do not administer antacids or other divalent salts with or within 2 hr of oral levofloxacin dose; otherwise may be administer with or without food.

Contraindications include acute MI, thyrotoxicosis, and uncorrected adrenal insufficiency. May cause hyperthyroidism, rash, growth disturbances, hypertension, worsening of diabetic control, decreased bone mineral density (primarily in post-menopausal females), arrhythmias, diarrhea, and weight loss. Pseudotumor cerebri and slipped capital femoral epiphysis have been reported in children. Overtreatment may cause craniosynostosis in infants and premature closure of the epiphyses in children.
Total replacement dose may be used in children unless there is evidence of cardiac disease; in that case, begin with one-fourth of maintenance and increase weekly. Titrate dosage with clinical status and serum T4 and TSH.
Increases the effects of warfarin. Phenytoin, rifampin, carbamazepine, iron and calcium supple- ments, antacids, grapefruit juice, and orlistat may decrease levothyroxine levels. Tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs may enhance toxic effects. Use with ketamine may cause hypertension and tachycardia. High doses of propranolol or dexamethasone, and amiodarone may decrease the conversion of T4 to T3.
100 mCg levothyroxine = 65 mg thyroid USP. Administer oral doses on an empty stomach and tablets with a full glass of water. Iron and calcium supplements and antacids may decrease absorption; do not administer within 4 hr of these agents. Excreted in low levels in breast milk; preponderance of evidence suggests no clinically significant effect in infants.

LIDOCAINE continued

For cardiac arrest, amiodarone is the preferred agent over lidocaine; lidocaine may used only when amiodarone is not available.
Contraindicated in Stokes-Adams or Wolff-Parkinson-White syndromes and SA, AV, or intraventricular heart block without a pacemaker. Solutions containing dextrose may be contraindicated in patients with known allergy to corn or corn products. Side effects include hypotension, asystole, seizures, and respiratory arrest. Anaphylaxic reactions have been reported. Local anesthetic use has been associated with methemoglobinemia.
CYP 450 2D6 and 3A3/4 substrate. Use with caution in severe liver or renal disease. Decrease dose in hepatic failure or decreased cardiac output. Do not use topically for teething. Prolonged infusion may result in toxic accumulation of lidocaine, especially in infants. Do not use epinephrine- containing solutions for treatment of arrhythmias.
Therapeutic levels 1.5-5 mg/L. Toxicity occurs at >7 mg/L. Toxicity in neonates may occur at >5 mg/L due to reduced protein binding of drug. Elimination T1/2: premature infant: 3.2 hr, adult: 1.5-2 hr.
When using the topical patch, avoid exposing the application site to external heat sources as this may increase the risk for toxicity.


Cream: Lidocaine 2.5% + prilocaine 2.5% (5, 30 g)
Peridontal gel (Oraqix): Lidocaine 2.5% + prilocaine 2.5% (1.7 g in dental cartridges; 20s)
See Chapter 6, for general use information.

Scabies: Apply thin layer of lotion to skin from the neck to toes. Most patients will require 30 mL and larger patient may require the maximum dose of 60 mL. Bathe and rinse off medication in adults after 8-12 hr; children 6-8 hr. Do not re-treat.
Pediculosis capitis: Apply =30 mL (amount depends on length and density of hair; max. dose: 60 mL) shampoo to dry hair without adding water. Work shampoo thoroughly into hair and allow to remain in place for 4 min. Then add small amounts of water to the hair until a good lather forms. Immediately rinse all the lather away and avoid contact of lather to other body surfaces. Towel dry and comb hair with fine-tooth comb to remove nits. Do not re-treat.
Pediculosis pubis: May use lotion or shampoo (applied locally) as for scabies and pediculosis capitis (see above).
Contraindicated in premature infants and seizure disorders. Use with caution with drugs that lower seizure threshold. Systemically absorbed. Risk of toxic effects is greater in young children; use other agents (permethrin) in infants, young children (<2 yr), and during pregnancy. Lindane is considered second-line therapy owing to side-effect risk and reports of resistance.
May cause a rash; rarely may cause seizures or aplastic anemia. For scabies, change clothing and bed sheets after starting treatment and treat family members. For pediculosis pubis, treat sexual contacts.
Avoid contact with face, urethral meatus, damaged skin, or mucous membranes. Do not use any covering that does not breathe (e.g., plastic lining or clothing) over the applied lindane.

Most common side effects include diarrhea, headache, and nausea. Anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia may occur in patients who are at risk for myelosuppression and who receive regimens >2 wk. Complete blood count monitoring is recommended in these individuals. Pseudomembranous colitis, neuropathy (peripheral and optic), and severe cutaneous adverse reactions (e.g., TEN and SJS) have also been reported. CSF penetration is variable in patients with VP shunts.
Do not use with SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine), tricyclic antidepressants, venlafaxine, and trazodone; may cause serotonin syndrome. Avoid use with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., phenelzine); and in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, pheochromocytoma, thyrotoxicosis, and taking sympathomimetics or vasopressive agents (may elevate blood pressure). Use caution when consuming large amounts of foods and beverages containing tyramine; may increase blood pressure. Dosing information in severe hepatic failure and renal impairment with multi-doses have not been completed.

GFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or ESRD on hemodialysis: 30 mg/24 hr
Lisdexamfetamine is a pro-drug of dextroamphetamine which requires activation by intestinal/hepatic metabolism.
Contraindicated in amphetamine or sympathomimetic hypersensitivity, symptomatic cardiovascular disease, moderate/severe hypertension, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, agitated states, drug/alcohol abuse history, and MAO inhibitors (concurrent or use within 14 days). As with other CNS simulant medications, serious cardiovascular events, including death, have been reported in patients with preexisting structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems. Use with caution in patients with hypertension, psychiatric conditions, and epilepsy. May cause insomnia, irritability, rash, appetite suppression/weight loss, dizziness, xerostomia, and GI disturbances. Dermatillomania, bruxism, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and TEN have been reported.
Urinary acidifying agents may reduce levels of amphetamines and urinary alkalinizing agent may increase levels. May increase the effects of TCAs; increase or decrease the effects
of guanfacine and phenytoin, and phenobarbital; and decrease the effects of adrenergic blockers, antihistamines, and antihypertensives. Norepinephrine may increase the effects of amphetamines.
Chewable tablets must be completely chewed before swallowing. Chewable tablet and capsule dos- age forms can be converted on an equal mg-per-mg basis.

6-16 yr: Start with 0.07-0.1 mg/kg/dose PO once daily; max. initial dose: 5 mg/dose. If needed, titrate dose upward at 1-2 wk intervals to doses up to 0.61 mg/kg/24 hr or 40 mg/24 hr (higher doses have not been evaluated).
Adult: Start with 10 mg PO once daily (use 5 mg if using a diuretic). If needed, increase dose by 5-10 mg/24 hr at 1-2 wk intervals. Usual dosage range: 10-40 mg/24 hr. Max. dose: 80 mg/24 hr.
Continued


LISINOPRIL continued
Use lower initial dose (50% of recommended dose) if using with a diuretic or with the presence of hyponatremia, hypovolemia, severe CHF, or decreased renal function.
Contraindicated in hypersensitivity and history of angioedema with other ACE inhibitors, and
in combination with a neprilysin inhibitor (e.g., sacubitril). Do not use with aliskiren in patients with diabetes. Avoid use with dialysis with high-flux membranes because anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. Use with caution in aortic or bilateral renal artery stenosis, and hepatic impairment. Side effects include cough, dizziness, headache, hyperkalemia, hypotension (espe- cially with concurrent diuretic or antihypertensive agent use), rash, and GI disturbances. Mood alterations, including depressive symptoms, have been reported.
Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with lisinopril and angiotensin receptor antagonists (e.g., losartin) or aliskiren is associated with increased risk for hypotension, syncope, hyperkale- mia, and renal impairment. Diabetic patients on lisinopril treated with oral antidiabetic agents should be monitored for hypoglycemia, especially during the first month of use. NSAIDs (e.g., indo- methacin) may decrease linsinopril's effects. Use with mTOR inhibitors (e.g., sirolimus, everolimus) may increase risk for angioedema. Adjust dose in renal impairment (see Chapter 31).
Onset of action: 1 hr with maximal effect in 6-8 hr. Long-term blood pressure monitoring is recom- mended at Q2-4 wk until good control is achieved, followed by Q3-4 mo.
Additional indications with limited data in children include proteinuria associated with mild IgA nephropathy, and renal protection for diabetes or renal parenchymal disease.
Lisinopril should be discontinued as soon as possible when pregnancy is detected.

Adolescent: 600-1800 mg/24 hr ÷ TID-QID PO (divided BID-TID using extended-release tablets).
Adult:
Initial: 300 mg TID PO. Adjust as needed to achieve therapeutic levels. Usual dose is about 300 mg TID-QID with immediate release dosage form. For extended-release tablets, 900-1800 mg/24 hr PO ÷ BID-TID.
Contraindicated in severe cardiovascular disease (including Brugada syndrome) or renal disease. Decreased sodium intake or increased sodium wasting, significant renal or cardiovascular disease, may increase lithium levels, resulting in toxicity. May cause goiter, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, hypothyroidism, arrhythmias, or sedation at therapeutic doses. Nephrotic syndrome has been reported.
Co-administration with diuretics, metronidazole, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists (e.g., losartan), or NSAIDs may increase risk for lithium toxicity. Use with iodine may increase risk for hypothyroidism. If used in combination with haloperidol, closely monitor neurologic toxicities

Contraindicated in narrow-angle glaucoma and severe hypotension. Use with caution in renal insufficiency (glucoronide metabolite clearance is reduced), hepatic insufficiency (may worsen hepatic encephalopathy; decrease dose with severe hepatic impairment), compromised pulmonary function, and use of CNS depressant medications. May cause respiratory depression, especially in combination with opioids and other sedatives. May also cause sedation, dizziness, mild ataxia, mood changes, rash, and GI symptoms.
Paradoxical excitation has been reported in children (10%-30% of patients <8 yr old).
When compared to diazepam for status epilepticus (3 mo-17 yr), lorazepam was found to be more sedating with a longer time to return to baseline mental status.
Significant respiratory depression and/or hypotension has been reported when used in combination with loxapine. Probenecid and valproic acid may increase the effects/toxicity of lorazepam and oral contraceptive steroids may decrease lorazepam's effects.
Injectable product may be given rectally. Benzyl alcohol and propylene glycol may be toxic to new- borns at higher doses.

Hypertension (see remarks; cont.):
=17 yr and adult: Start with 50 mg PO once daily (use lower initial dose of 25 mg PO once daily if patient receiving diuretics, experiencing intravascular volume depletion, or has hepatic impair- ment). Usual maintenance dose is 25-100 mg/24 hr PO ÷ once daily-BID
Use with caution in angioedema (current or past), excessive hypotension (volume depletion), hepatic (use lower starting dose) or renal (contains potassium) impairment, hyperkalemia (including use with medications that can cause hyperkalemia), renal artery stenosis and severe CHF. Not recommended in patients <6 yr or in children with GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2, owing to lack of data.
Discontinue use as soon as possible when pregnancy is detected because injury and death to devel- oping fetus may occur. Pregnancy category is "C" during the first trimester but changes to "D" for the second and third trimesters.
Diarrhea, asthenia, dizziness, fatigue, and hypotension are common. Thrombocytopenia, rhabdomy- olysis, hallucinations, and angioedema have been rarely reported.
Losartan is a substrate for CYP 450 2C9 (major) and 3A4. Fluconazole and cimetidine may increase losartan effects/toxicity. Rifampin, phenobarbital, and indomethacin may decrease its effects. Losartan may increase the risk of lithium toxicity. Do not use with aliskiren in patients with dia- betes or with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min). Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with losartin and ACE inhibitors (e.g., captopril) or aliskiren is associated with increased risk for hypotension, syncope, hyperkalemia, and renal impairment.

aor less frequently as studies have not been conducted in severe hepatic impairment.

Dosage modification when used with CYP 450 3A inhibitors:
Already taking Orkambi and initiating a strong CYP 450 3A inhibitor (e.g., itraconazole): no dosage adjustment
Already taking a strong CYP 450 3A inhibitor and initiating Orkambi: Reduce Orkambi dosage to 1 tablet or 1 packet of granules every other day × the first week followed by the recommended daily dose. If Orkambi is interrupted for >1 wk and re-initiated while taking strong CYP 450 3A inhibitors, Orkambi should be reintroduced with the reduced dosage of 1 tablet or 1 packet of granules every other day × 1 wk followed by the recommended daily dose.
Works on CFTR trafficking defect by acting as a CFTR corrector (lumecaftor) and in combination with a CFTR potentiator (ivacaftor). Indicated for individuals with homozygous F508del CFTR mutation.
Respiratory events, such as chest discomfort, dyspnea and abnormal respiration, may occur dur- ing the initiation of therapy and may vary from transient to severe (requiring discontinuation). Common side effects include rash, diarrhea, nausea, flatulence, fatigue, nasal discharge, and URIs. Increased liver enzymes and cataracts may occur; monitor AST/ALT and ocular exam at baseline. Repeat AST/ALT every 3 mo for the first year followed by annual assessments. Repeat ocular exams annually. Hypertension has been reported. May cause a false positive urine drug screen for cannabinoids.
Use with caution with CrCl =30 mL/min and ESRD. Reduce dose with moderate/severe hepatic impairment (see dosage section) or when initiating therapy while taking a strong CYP 450 3A4 inhibitor.
Lumecaftor is a strong inducer of CYP 450 3A and ivacaftor is a CYP 450 3A substrate; see dose modification table in the dosing section. Use with strong CYP 450 3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, St. John's wort) are not recommended. Lumecaftor/ivacaftor may reduce the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives and increase the incidence of menstruation-associated side effects (e.g., amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, and irregular menses). Always evaluate potential drug-drug interactions; see https://www.orkambihcp.com/drug-interactionsddi-tool. Avoid food or drink containing grapefruit or Seville oranges.
Administer all doses with high-fat foods to assure absorption. Oral granules can be mixed with 5 mL of soft foods or liquids such as puréed fruits or vegetables, yogurt, applesauce, water, breast milk, infant formula, milk, or juice. Once mixed, it should be consumed within an hour. If a dose (all dosage forms) is missed within 6 hr of a scheduled dose, administer a dose immediately. However, if the missed dose is >6 hr, skip that dose and resume therapy at the next scheduled dose. Never take a double dose for a missed dose.

Contraindicated in active or recent history of depression, anxiety disorders, psychosis or schizophrenia, seizures, or hypersensitivity to quinine or quinidine. Use with caution in cardiac dysrhythmias and neurologic disease. May cause dizziness, ringing of the ears, headache, syncope, psychiatric symptoms (e.g., anxiety, paranoia, depression, hallucinations, and psychotic behavior), seizures, ocular abnormalities, GI symptoms, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. If neurologic or psychiatric side effects occur, discontinue therapy and use an alternative medication. Most adverse events occur within 3 doses with prophylaxis use. Monitor liver enzymes and ocular exams for therapies >1 yr.
Mefloquine is a substrate and inhibitor of P-glycoprotein and may reduce valproic acid levels. ECG abnormalities may occur when used in combination with quinine, quinidine, chloroquine, halofantrine, and ß-blockers. If any of the aforementioned antimalarial drugs is used in the initial treatment of severe malaria, initiate mefloquine at least 12 hr after the last dose of any of these drugs. Do not initiate halofantrine or ketoconazole within 15 days of the last dose
of mefloquine. Use with chloroquine may increase risk for seizures. Rifampin may decrease mefloquine levels.
Do not take on an empty stomach. Administer with at least 240 mL (8 oz) water. Treatment failures in children may be related to vomiting of administered dose. If vomiting occurs less than 30
min after the dose, administer a second full dose. If vomiting occurs 30-60 min after the dose, administer an additional half-dose. If vomiting continues, monitor patient closely and consider alternative therapy.

renal function, pyloric stenosis, and concurrent thrombolytics. May cause headache, GI discomfort, pancreatitis, pericarditis, and rash. Angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, DRESS, fatal infections (e.g., sepsis and pneumonia; discontinue use), and photosensitivity have been reported. May cause a false-positive urinary normetanephrine test.
Safety and efficacy of Asacol in children 5-17 yr for mild/moderate acute ulcerative colitis have been established over a 6 wk period. However, efficacy for maintenance of remission was not established in a 26 wk RCT (potential factors affecting outcome included improper dosage used and premature termination of trial). Safety and efficacy of Canasa suppositories have not been demonstrated for mild/moderate active ulcerative proctitis in a 6-wk open-label study in 49 patients 5-17 yr old.
Do not administer with lactulose or other medications that can lower intestinal pH. Use with myelo- suppressive drugs (e.g., azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine may increase risk for blood disorders, bone marrow failure and associated complications.
Two Delzicol 400-mg capsules have not been shown to be interchangeable or substitutable with one mesalamine 800-mg delayed-release tablet. Oral capsules are designed to release medication throughout the GI tract and oral tablets release medication at the terminal ileus and beyond. 400 mg PO mesalamine is equivalent to 1 g sulfasalazine PO.

METFORMIN continued
Assess patient's eGFR prior to initiating therapy. Contraindicated in severe renal impairment (<30 mL/min/1.73 m2), hepatic impairment (increased risk for lactic acidosis), CHF, and metabolic acidosis and during radiology studies using iodinated contrast media. Use with caution when transferring patients from chlorpropamide therapy (potential hypoglycemia risk), excessive alcohol intake, hypoxemia, dehydration, surgical procedures, mild/moderate renal impairment, hepatic disease, anemia, and thyroid disease.
Fatal lactic acidosis (diarrhea; severe muscle pain, cramping; shallow and fast breathing; unusual weakness and sleepiness) and decrease in vitamin B12 levels have been reported. May cause GI discomfort (~50% incidence), anorexia, and vomiting. Transient abdominal discomfort or diar- rhea have been reported in 40% of pediatric patients. Organic cationic transporter-2 (OCT2)and multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE)inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine), furosemide, and nifedipine may increase the effects/toxicity of metformin. In addition to monitoring serum glucose and glycosyl- ated hemoglobin, monitor renal function and hematologic parameters (baseline and annual).
Adult patients initiated on 500 mg PO BID may also have their dose increased to 850 mg PO BID after 2 wk.
COMBINATION THERAPY WITH SULFONYLUREAS: If patient has not responded to 4 wk of maximum doses of metformin monotherapy, consider gradual addition of an oral sulfonylurea with continued maximum metformin dosing (even if failure with sulfonylurea has occurred). Attempt to identify the minimum effective dosage for each drug (metformin and sulfonylurea) because the combination can increase risk for sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia. If patient does not respond to 1-3 mo of combination therapy with maximum metformin doses, consider discontinuing combination therapy and initiating insulin therapy.
Administer all doses with food.

Unintentional overdoses have resulted in fatalities and severe adverse events such as respiratory depression and cardiac arrhythmias. Use with caution in hepatic (avoid in severe cases) and biliary tract impairment. May cause respiratory depression, sedation, increased intracranial pressure, hypotension, and bradycardia. Cardiac QT interval prolongation and serious arrhythmias have occurred mostly with higher doses; avoid use with other medications which may prolong QT interval.
Average T1/2: children 19 hr, and adults 35 hr. Duration of action PO is 6-8 hr initially and 22-48 hr after repeated doses. Respiratory effects last longer than analgesia. Accumulation may occur with continuous use making it necessary to adjust dose.

Nevirapine may decrease serum levels of methadone. Fatalities have been reported with abuse in combination with benzodiazepines. Serotonin syndrome has been reported with use with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRIs), TCAs, 5-HT3 antagonists, MAO inhibitors, and drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter
system (e.g., trazodone, tramadol). Methadone is a substrate for CYP 450 3A3/4, 2D6, and 1A2 and inhibitor of 2D6.
See Chapter 6 for equianalgesic dosing and onset of action. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).
A Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)is required for healthcare providers to ensure the benefits outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse. See www.fda.gov/ OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint or call 1-800-503-0784.

Contraindicated in pheochromocytoma and active liver disease. Use with caution if patient is receiving haloperidol, propranolol, lithium, or sympathomimetics. Positive Coombs test rarely associated with hemolytic anemia. Fever, leukopenia, sedation, memory impairment, hepatitis, GI disturbances, orthostatic hypotension, black tongue, and gynecomastia may occur. May interfere with lab tests for creatinine, urinary catecholamines, uric acid, and AST.
May increase the AV blocking effects of ß-blockers and antihypertensive effects of other antihyperten-
sives. a2-antagonist antidepressants, serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and methyl- phenidate may reduce the antihypertensive effects of methyldopa. Do not use in combination with MAO inhibitors (may enhance adverse effects of methyldopa). Do not coadminister oral doses with iron; decreases methyldopa absorption. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).

Injection: 10 mg/mL (1%) (1, 10 mL)
Intravenous solution (ProvayBlue): 50 mg/10 mL (10 mL)

Metadate ER (8-hr duration of action): Convert immediate-release tabs when the 8-hr dosage cor- responds to the available extended-release tablet size. Usual max. dose: 60 mg/24 hr for children but some patients >50 kg may tolerate doses up to 100 mg/24 hr with increased monitoring.
Transdermal patch (Daytrana; see remarks): Apply to the hip 2 hr before the effect is needed and remove 9 hr later. Patch may be removed before 9 hr if shorter duration of effect is desired or if late day adverse effects appear.
6-17 yr: Start with 10 mg/9 hr patch once daily. Increase dose PRN Q7 days by increasing to the next dosage strength. Higher starting doses have been reported in patients converting from oral-dosage forms >20 mg/24 hr.
Contraindicated in glaucoma, anxiety disorders, motor tics, and Tourette syndrome. Medication should generally not be used in children <5 yr old; diagnosis of ADHD in this age group is extremely difficult and should be only done in consultation with a specialist. Sudden death (children, adolescents, and adults), stroke (adults), and MI (adults) have been reported in patients with preexisting structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems. Use with caution in patients with hypertension, psychiatric conditions, and epilepsy.
Insomnia, weight loss, anorexia, rash, nausea, emesis, abdominal pain, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, palpitations, restlessness, headaches, fever, tremor, visual disturbances, and thrombocytopenia may occur. Abnormal liver function (ranging from transaminase elevation to severe hepatic injury), cerebral arteritis and/or occlusion, peripheral vasculopathy (including Raynaud phenomenon), leukopenia and/or anemia, hypersensitivity reactions, transient depressed mood, paranoia, mania, auditory hallucination, priapism, and scalp hair loss have been reported. Skin irritation, chemical leukoderma, and contact dermatitis have been reported with transdermal route. High doses

METHYLPHENIDATE HCL continued
May increase serum concentrations/effects of tricyclic antidepressants, dopamine agonists (e.g., haloperidol), phenytoin, phenobarbital, and warfarin. May decrease the effects of antihypertensive drugs. Effect of methylphenidate may be potentiated by MAO inhibitors; hypertensive crisis may also occur if used within 14 days of discontinuance of the MAO inhibitor.
Extended/sustained-release dosage forms have either an 8- or 24-hr dosage interval (as stipulated previously). Concerta dosage form delivers 22.2% of its dose as an immediate-release product with the remaining amounts as an extended-release product (e.g., 18-mg strength: 4 mg as immediate release and 14 mg as extended release). Jornay PM is dosed only in the evening and should NOT be taken in the morning. Do not consume alcohol with Ritalin LA dosage form, because it may result in a more rapid release of the drug. Do not expose transdermal application site to external heat sources (e.g., electric blankets, heating pads); this may increase drug release.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and tardive dyskinesia (increase risk with prolong duration of therapy; avoid use >12 wk) have been reported.
Metoclopramide is a substrate for CYP 450 2D6; inhibitors to this enzyme may increase risk metoclo- pramide toxicity. G6PD deficiency may increase risk for methemoglobinemia; DO NOT use methylene blue as it may cause a fatal hemolytic anemia.
For GER, give 30 min before meals and at bedtime. Reduce dose in renal impairment (see Chapter 31).



Edema: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ once daily-BID PO
Adult:
Hypertension: 2.5-5 mg once daily PO
Edema: 2.5-20 mg once daily PO
Contraindicated in patients with anuria, hepatic coma, or hypersensitivity to sulfonamides or thiazides.

Adult:
Non-extended-release tabs: Start at 50-100 mg/24 hr PO ÷ once daily-BID; if needed, increase dosage at weekly intervals to desired blood pressure. Usual effective dosage range is 100-200 mg/24 hr. Doses >450 mg/24 hr have not been studied. Patients with bronchospastic diseases should receive the lowest possible daily dose divided TID.
Extended-release tabs: Start at 25-100 mg/24 hr PO once daily; if needed, increase dosage at weekly intervals to desired blood pressure. Usual dosage range is 50-200 mg/24 hr. Doses >400 mg/24 hr have not been studied.
Contraindicated in sinus bradycardia, heart block >1st degree, sick sinus syndrome (except with functioning pacemaker), cardiogenic shock, and uncompensated CHF. Use with caution in hepatic dysfunction, peripheral vascular disease, history of severe anaphylactic hypersensitivity drug reactions, pheochromocytoma, and concurrent use with verapamil, diltiazem, or anesthetic agents that may decrease myocardial function. Should not be used with bronchospastic diseases. Reserpine and other drugs that deplete catecholamines (e.g., MAO inhibitors) may increase the effects of metoprolol. Metoprolol is a CYP 450 2D6 substrate. Poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers who concomitantly use CYP 2D6 inhibitors will have significant increases in metoprolol blood levels to decrease its cardioselectivity.
Avoid abrupt cessation of therapy in ischemic heart disease; angina, ventricular arrhythmias, and MI have occurred. Common side effects include bradyarrhythmia, heart block, heart failure, pruritus, rash, GI disturbances, dizziness, fatigue, and depression. Bronchospasm, dyspnea, and elevations in transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and LDH have all been reported.

MICAFUNGIN SODIUM continued
No dosing adjustments are required based on race or gender, or in patients with severe renal dysfunction or mild to moderate hepatic function impairment. Effect of severe hepatic function impairment on micafungin pharmacokinetics has not been evaluated. Higher dosage requirements in premature and young infants may be attributed to the faster drug clearance due to lower protein binding. Higher treatment doses in infants and children have been reported at 8.6-12 mg/kg/dose IV once daily.
May cause GI disturbances, phlebitis, rash, hyperbilirubinemia, liver function test elevation, head- ache, fever, and rigor. Anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, TEN, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and hemolysis have been reported. Micafungin is CYP450 3A isoenzyme substrate and weak inhibitor. May increase the effects/toxicity of nifedipine and sirolimus.
Safety and efficacy in children =4 mo have been demonstrated based on well-controlled studies and
pharmacokinetic/safety studies.

sedation that is uncharacteristic of the patient during a seizure episode. Max. dose: 10 mg/dose per episode; not to exceed one episode every 3 days and 5 episodes per month.
Contraindicated in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma and shock. Use with caution in CHF, renal impairment (adjust dose; see Chapter 31), pulmonary disease, hepatic dysfunction, and neonates. Causes respiratory depression, hypotension, and bradycardia. Cardiovascular monitoring is recommended. Use lower doses or reduce dose when given in combination with narcotics or in patients with respiratory compromise.
Higher recommended dosage for younger patients (6 mo-5 yr) is attributed to the water-soluble properties of midazolam and the higher percent body water for younger patients.
Drug is a substrate for CYP 450 3A4. Serum concentrations may be increased by cimetidine, clarithro- mycin, diltiazem, erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, ranitidine, and protease inhibitors (use contraindicated). Sedative effects may be antagonized by theophylline. Effects can be reversed by flumazenil. For pharmacodynamic information, see Chapter 6.
Do not prime Nayzilam intranasal dosage form, because this will promote drug loss.


Injection: 1 mg/mL (10, 20, 50 mL)
Premixed injection in D5W: 200 mCg/mL (100, 200 mL)
Child (limited data): 50 mCg/kg IV bolus over 15 min, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.25-0.75 mCg/kg/min and titrate to effect.
Adult: 50 mCg/kg IV bolus over 10 min, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.375-0.75 mCg/kg/min and titrate to effect. Max. dose: 1.13 mg/kg/24 hr.
Contraindicated in severe aortic stenosis, severe pulmonic stenosis, and acute MI. May cause headache, dysrhythmias, hypotension, hypokalemia, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, hepatotoxicity, and thrombocytopenia. Pediatric patients may require higher mCg/kg/min doses because of a faster elimination T1/2 and larger volume of distribution, when compared with adults. Hemodynamic effects can last up to 3-5 hr after discontinuation of infusion in children. Reduce dose in renal impairment.

MOMETASONE FUROATE ± FOMOTEROL FUMARATE continued
Mometasone is a CYP 450 3A4 substrate; concurrent administration with ketoconazole and other CYP 450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., protease inhibitors) may increase mometasone levels, resulting in Cushing syndrome and adrenal suppression. Blurred vision, cataracts, and glaucoma have been reported. Use with caution with hepatic impairment; increased drug exposure is possible.
INTRANASAL: Clear nasal passages and shake nasal spray well before each use. Onset of action for nasal symptoms of allergic rhinitis has been shown to occur within 11 hr after the first dose. Nasal burning and irritation may occur. Nasal septal perforation and taste and smell disturbances have been rarely reported. A clinical trial in children 6-17 yr old was not able to demonstrate effective- ness for treating nasal polyps.
ORAL INHALATION (all forms): Rinse mouth after each use. Fever, allergic rhinitis, URI, UTI, GI discomfort, and sore throat have been reported in children. Musculoskeletal pain, oral candidiasis, arthralgia, and fatigue may occur. May potentially worsen tuberculosis, fungal, bacterial, viral or parasitic infection, or ocular herpes simplex. Do not use Asmanex Twisthaler if allergic to milk proteins. The Twisthaler dosage form requires a minimum 30-60 L/min inspiratory flow rate to assure proper dose delivery. Breast-feeding information is currently unknown, but most experts consider use of inhaled corticosteroids acceptable.
MOMETASONE + FOMOTEROL (Dulera): Common side effects include nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, and headache. Angioedema, anaphylaxis, and arrhythmias have been reported. See Formoterol for additional remarks.
TOPICAL USE: HPA axis suppression and skin atrophy have been reported with cream and ointment use in infants 6-23 mo. Avoid application/contact to face, eyes, underarms, groin, and mucous membranes. Occlusive dressings and use in diaper dermatitis are not recommended.

MORPHINE SULFATE continued
Naloxone may be used to reverse effects, especially respiratory depression. Causes histamine release resulting in itching and possible bronchospasm. Low-dose naloxone infusion may be used for itching. Inflammatory masses (e.g., granulomas) have been reported with continuous infusions via indwelling intrathecal catheters.
Dosage reduction may be necessary with liver cirrhosis. See Chapter 6 for equianalgesic dosing. Pregnancy category changes to "D" if used for prolonged periods or in higher doses at term. Rectal dosing is same as oral dosing but is not recommended due to poor absorption. Controlled/ sustained-release oral tablets must be administered whole. Controlled-release oral capsules may be opened and the entire contents sprinkled on applesauce immediately prior to ingestion. Be aware of the various oral solution concentrations; the concentrated oral solution (100 mg/5 mL) has been associated with accidental overdoses. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).
The FDA has assigned a REMS for Opioid Analgesia; see www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG. The REMS strongly encourages the (1) completion of a REMS-compliant education program; (2) counsel patients/caregivers on prescription safe use, risks, storage, and disposal; (3) emphasize the importance of reading the Medication Guide provided by pharmacists at all times; and (4) consider other methods for improving patient, household, and community safety.

MYCOPHENOLATE continued
Mycophenolate mofetil (cont.):
Oral suspension: 200 mg/mL (160 mL); contains phenylalanine (0.56 mg/mL) and methylparabens
Injection: 500 mg; may contain polysorbate 80
Mycophenolic acid:
Delayed-release tabs (Myfortic and generics): 180, 360 mg
Caps, tabs, or suspension: 600 mg/m2/dose PO/IV BID up to a max. dose of 2000 mg/24 hr; alternatively, patients with body surface areas (BSAs)=1.25 m2 may be dosed as follows:
1.25-1.5 m2: 750 mg PO BID
>1.5 m2: 1000 mg PO BID
Delayed-release tabs (Myfortic; =5 yr): 400 mg/m2/dose PO BID; max. dose: 720 mg BID; this dosage form not recommended in patients with BSAs <1.19 m2. Alternatively, patients with BSAs
=1.19 m2 may be dosed as follows:
1.19-1.58 m2: 540 mg PO BID
>1.58 m2: 720 mg PO BID
Nephrotic syndrome:
Frequently relapsing: 12.5-18 mg/kg/dose or 600 mg/m2/dose PO BID up to a max. dose of 2000 mg/24 hr for 1-2 yr and taper prednisone regimen.
Steroid dependent: 12-18 mg/kg/dose or 600 mg/m2/dose PO BID up to a max. dose of 2000 mg/24 hr for at least 12 mo.
Adult (in combination with corticosteroids and cyclosporine; check specific transplantation proto- col for specific dosage):
IV: 2000-3000 mg/24 hr ÷ BID
Oral:
Caps, tabs, or suspension: 2000-3000 mg/24 hr PO ÷ BID
Delayed-release tabs (Myfortic): 720-1080 mg PO BID
Check specific transplantation protocol for specific dosage. Mycophenolate mofetil is a prodrug for mycophenolic acid. Owing to differences in absorption, the delayed-release tablets should not be interchanged with other oral-dosage forms on an equivalent milligram-to-milligram basis. Increases risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and increased risk of congenital malformations (especially external ear and facial abnormalities including cleft lip and palate, and anomalies of the distal limbs, heart, and esophagus).
Common side effects may include headache, hypertension, diarrhea, vomiting, bone marrow suppres- sion, anemia, fever, opportunistic infections, and sepsis. May cause drowsiness and increase the risk for bacterial, fungal, protozoal, and viral infections, and lymphomas or other malignancies. GI bleeds and increased risk for rejection in heart transplant patients switched from calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine and tacrolimus) and CellCept to sirolimus and CellCept have been reported. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), and hypogammaglobulinemia have also been reported.
Use of mycophenolic acid (Myfortic) should be avoided in patients with hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) deficiency (e.g., Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome) because it may exacerbate disease symptoms characterized by increased uric acid leading to acute arthritis, tophi, nephrolithiasis/urolithiasis, and renal failure.
Use with caution in patients with active GI disease or renal impairment (GFR <25 mL/min/1.73 m2) outside of the immediate posttransplant period. In adults with renal impairment, avoid doses >2 g/24 hr and observe carefully. Dose should be interrupted or reduced in the presence of neutropenia (ANC <1.3 × 103/microliter). No dose adjustment is needed for patients experiencing delayed graft function postoperatively.

MYCOPHENOLATE continued
Drug interactions: (1) Displacement of phenytoin or theophylline from protein-binding sites will decrease total serum levels and increase free serum levels of these drugs. Salicylates displace mycophenolate to increase free levels of mycophenolate. (2) Competition for renal tubular secretion results in increased serum levels of acyclovir, ganciclovir, probenecid, and mycophenolate (when any of these are used together). (3) Avoid live and live attenuated vaccines (including influenza); decreases vaccine effectiveness. (4) Proton pump inhibitors, antacids, cholestyramine, cyclospo- rine, and telmisartan may reduce mycophenolate levels.
Administer oral doses on an empty stomach. Infuse intravenous doses over 2 hr. Oral suspension may be administered via NG tube with a minimum size of 8 Fr.

Nasal liquid (Narcan): 2 mg/0.1 mL (4 each), 4 mg/0.1 mL (2 each); contains benzalkonium chloride
Neonate, infant, child =20 kg or =5 yr: 0.1 mg/kg/dose. May repeat PRN Q2-3 min.
Child >20 kg or >5 yr: 2 mg/dose. May repeat PRN Q2-3 min.
Continuous infusion (child and adult): 0.005 mg/kg loading dose followed by infusion of 0.0025 mg/ kg/hr has been recommended. A range of 0.0025-0.16 mg/kg/hr has been reported. Taper gradu- ally to avoid relapse.
Adult: 0.4-2 mg/dose. May repeat PRN Q2-3 min. Use 0.1- to 0.2-mg increments in opiate-dependent patients.
Intranasal route for opiate intoxication (full reversal):
All ages: 4 mg (0.1 mL) of nasal liquid (Narcan) into one nostril Q2-3 min PRN in alternating nostrils.
Opioid-dependent patient at risk for opioid withdrawal: Use lower 2 mg (0.1 mL) nasal liquid (Narcan) into one nostril Q2-3 min PRN in alternating nostrils. Alternatively, the 2 mg/2 mL intravenous (IV) syringe dosage form with nasal adapter may be used by administering 1 mg (1 mL) per nostril.
Opiate-induced pruritus (limited data): 0.25-2 mCg/kg/hr IV; a dose-finding study in 59 children suggests a minimal dose of 1 mCg/kg/hr when used as prophylactic therapy. Doses =3 mCg/kg/hr increases the risk for reduced pain control.
Short duration of action may necessitate multiple doses. For severe intoxication, doses of 0.2 mg/kg may be required. If no response is achieved after a cumulative dose of 10 mg, reevaluate diagnosis. In the nonarrest situation, use the lowest dose effective (may start at 0.001 mg/kg/dose). See Chapter 6 for additional information.
Will produce narcotic withdrawal syndrome in patients with chronic dependence. Use with caution in patients with chronic cardiac disease. Abrupt reversal of narcotic depression may result in nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, tachycardia, hypertension, and tremulousness. Aggressive behavior has been reported in abrupt reversal of an opioid overdose. False-positive test for urine opiates screen may occur.
IV administration is preferred. Onset of action may be delayed with other routes of administration.

Use with caution in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction. Contraindicated in moderate/ severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C) and postexposure (occupational or nonoccupational) prophylactic regimens. Most frequent side effects with continuous therapy include skin rash (may be life-threatening, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and DRESS; permanently discontinue and never restart), fever, abnormal liver function tests, headache, and
nausea. Discontinue therapy if any of the following occurs: severe rash; rash with fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis or muscle aches. Permanently discontinue and do not restart therapy if symptomatic hepatitis, severe transaminase elevations or hypersensitivity reactions occur.
Life-threatening hepatotoxicity has been reported primarily during the first 12 wk of continuous therapy. Patients with increased serum transaminase or a history of hepatitis B or C infection prior to nevirapine are at greater risk for hepatotoxicity. Women, including pregnant women, with CD4 cell counts >250/mm3 or men with CD4 cell counts >400/mm3 are at risk for hepatotoxicity. Monitor liver function tests (obtain transaminases immediately after development of hepatitis signs/symptoms,
hypersensitivity reactions, or rash) and complete blood counts. Hypophosphatemia has been reported.
Nevirapine induces the CYP 450 3A4 drug metabolizing isoenzyme to cause an autoinduction of its own metabolism within the first 2-4 wk of therapy and has the potential to interact with many drugs. Carefully review the patient's drug profile for other drug interactions each time nevirap- ine is initiated or when a new drug is added to a regimen containing nevirapine.
Doses can be administered with food and concurrently with didanosine.

Hypertension:
Oral:
Immediate release: 20 mg PO TID, dose may be increased after 3 days to 40 mg PO TID if needed.
Sustained release: 30 mg PO BID, dose may be increased after 3 days to 60 mg PO BID if needed.
Continuous IV infusion: Start at 5 mg/hr, increase dose as needed by 2.5 mg/hr Q5-15 min up to a max. dose of 15 mg/hr. Following attainment of desired BP, decrease infusion to 3 mg/hr and adjust rate as needed to maintain desired response.
Reported use in children has been limited to a small number of preterm infants, infants, and children.
Contraindicated in advanced aortic stenosis. Avoid systemic hypotension in patients following an acute cerebral infarct or hemorrhage. Use with caution in hepatic or renal dysfunction by
carefully titrating dose. The drug undergoes significant first-pass metabolism through the liver and is excreted in the urine (60%). Use caution when converting to another dosage form; they are NOT equivalent on a milligram-per-milligram basis.
May cause headache, dizziness, asthenia, peripheral edema, and GI symptoms. Nicardipine is a sub- strate for CYP 450 3A and inhibitor of CYP 450 2 C9/19. Cimetidine increases the effects/toxicity of nicardipine. Nicardipine may increase effect/toxicity of cyclosporine and tacrolimus. See Nifedipine for additional drug and food interactions.
Onset of action for orally administered drug is 20 min with peak effects in 0.5 to 2 hr. Onset of action of intravenously administered drug is 1 min. Duration of action following a single IV or PO dose is 3 hr. To reduce the risk for venous thrombosis, phlebitis, and vascular impairment with IV admin- istration, do not use small veins (e.g., dorsum of hand or wrist). Avoid intra-arterial administration or extravasation. For additional information, see Chapter 4.

Child (see remarks for precautions):
Chronic hypertension:
Sustained release tabs: Start with 0.25-0.5 mg/kg/24 hr (initial max. dose: 30-60 mg/24 hr) ÷ Q12-24 hr. May increase to max. dose: 3 mg/kg/24 hr up to 120 mg/24 hr.
Adult:
Chronic hypertension or angina:
Sustained-release tabs: Start with 30 or 60 mg PO once daily. May increase to max. dose of 90 mg/24 hr for Adalat CC, Afeditab CR, and Nifediac CC, and 120 mg/24 hr for Procardia XL.
Use of immediate-release dosage form in children is controversial and has been abandoned by many. Use with caution in children with acute CNS injury due to increased risk for stroke, seizure, hepatic impairment, and altered level of consciousness. To prevent rapid decrease in blood pressure in children, an initial dose of =0.25 mg/kg is recommended.
Use with caution in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), aortic stenosis, GI obstruction/ narrowing (bezoar formation), and cirrhosis (reduced drug clearance). May cause severe hypoten- sion, peripheral edema, flushing, tachycardia, headaches, dizziness, nausea, palpitations, and syncope. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis has been reported.
Although overall use in adults has been abandoned, the immediate-release dosage form is contraindicated in adults with severe obstructive coronary artery disease or recent MI and in hypertensive emergencies.
Nifedipine is a substrate for CYP 450 3A3/4, and 3A5-7. Do not administer with grapefruit juice; may increase bioavailability and effects. Itraconazole and ketoconazole may increase nifedipine levels and/or effects. CYP 3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamaze- pine) may reduce nifedipine's effects. Nifedipine may increase phenytoin, cyclosporine, and digoxin levels. For hypertensive emergencies, see Chapter 4.
For sublingual (SL) administration, capsule must be punctured and liquid expressed into the patient's mouth. A small amount is absorbed via the SL route. Most effects are due to swallowing and oral absorption. Do not crush or chew sustained-release tablet dosage form.

NITROFURANTOIN continued

Contraindicated in severe renal disease, infants below 1 mo of age, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) below 60 mL/min (reduced drug distribution the urine), active/previous cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction, and pregnant women at term. Use with caution in G6PD deficiency, anemia, lung disease, and peripheral neuropathy. May cause nausea, hypersensitivity reactions (including vasculitis), vomiting, cholestatic jaundice, headache, hepatotoxicity, polyneuropathy, and hemolytic anemia.
Anticholinergic drugs and high-dose probenecid may increase nitrofurantoin toxicity. Magnesium salts may decrease nitrofurantoin absorption. Causes false-positive urine glucose with Clinitest. Administer doses with food or milk.
Pregnancy category changes to X at term (38-42 wk gestation). Breastfeeding in mothers receiving nitrofurantoin is not recommended for infants below 1 mo and those with G6PD deficiency; use in infants 1 mo and without G6PD deficiency is compatible.

NITROGLYCERIN continued

Patch: 0.2-0.4 mg/hr initially, then titrate to 0.4-0.8 mg/hr; apply new patch daily (tolerance is minimized by removing patch for 10-12 hr/24 hr)
Contraindicated in glaucoma, with increased ICP, cerebral hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, shock, severe anemia, concurrent phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (e.g., sildenafil), and concurrent guanylate cyclase stimulator (e.g., riociguat). In small doses (1-2 mCg/kg/ min) acts mainly on systemic veins and decreases preload. At 3-5 mCg/kg/min acts on systemic arterioles to decrease resistance. May cause headache, flushing, hypersensitivity reactions, hypotension, GI upset, blurred vision, and methemoglobinemia. Use with caution in severe renal impairment, and hepatic failure. IV nitroglycerin may antagonize anticoagulant effect of heparin.
Decrease dose gradually in patients receiving drug for prolonged periods to avoid withdrawal reac- tion. Must use polypropylene infusion sets to avoid adsorption of drug to plastic tubing. Use in heparized patients may result in a decrease of PTT with subsequent rebound effect on discontinu- ation of nitroglycerin.
Onset (duration) of action: IV: 1-2 min (3-5 min); sublingual: 1-3 min (30-60 min); PO sustained release: 40 min (4-8 hr); topical ointment: 20-60 min (2-12 hr); and transdermal patch: 40-60
min (18-24 hr).





Injection:
Nitropress and generics: 25 mg/mL (2 mL)
Prediluted injection in 0.9% sodium chloride:
Nipride RTU: 0.2 mg/mL (100 mL), 0.5 mg/mL (100 mL)
Child, adolescent, and adult: IV, continuous infusion
Dose: Start at 0.3-0.5 mCg/kg/min, titrate to effect. Usual dose is 3-4 mCg/kg/min.
Max. dose: 10 mCg/kg/min.
Contraindicated in patients with decreased cerebral perfusion and in situations of compensatory hypertension (increased ICP). Monitor for hypotension and acidosis. Dilute with D5W and protect from light.
Pediatric efficacy is supported by a dose-ranging trial, an open-label trial, and adult trials. No novel safety issues were found in the aforementioned pediatric trials.
Nitroprusside is nonenzymatically converted to cyanide, which is converted to thiocyanate. Cyanide may produce metabolic acidosis and methemoglobinemia; thiocyanate may produce psychosis and seizures. Monitor thiocyanate levels if used for more than 48 hr or in a dose equal to or greater than 4 mCg/kg/min. Thiocyanate levels should be less than 50 mg/L. Monitor cyanide levels (toxic levels >2 mCg/mL) in patients with hepatic dysfunction and thiocyanate levels in patients with renal dysfunction.
Onset of action is 2 min with a 1- to 10-min duration of effect.



Injection: 1 mg/mL as norepinephrine base (4 mL); may contain sulfites
NOTE: The dosage units for children are in mCg/kg/min compared with mCg/min for adults. Child: Continuous IV infusion doses as norepinephrine base. Start at 0.05-0.1 mCg/kg/min.
Titrate to effect. Max. dose: 2.5 mCg/kg/min.
Adult: Continuous IV infusion doses as norepinephrine base. Start at 8-12 mCg/min and titrate to effect. Usual maintenance dosage range: 2-4 mCg/min.
May cause cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, hypersensitivity, headaches, vomiting, uterine contractions, and organ ischemia. May cause decreased renal blood flow and urine output. Avoid extravasation into tissues; may cause severe tissue necrosis. If this occurs, treat locally with phentolamine.


Caps: 10, 25, 50, 75 mg; may contain benzyl alcohol, EDTA
Oral solution: 10 mg/5 mL (473 mL); contains up to 4% alcohol, benzoic acid, and sorbitol
Depression (see remarks):

>11 yr (36-54 kg): 25-35 mg PO QHS
See imipramine for contraindications and common side effects. Also contraindicated with linezolid or IV methylene blue due to increased risk for serotonin syndrome. Avoid use in patients with Brugada syndrome. Fewer CNS and anticholinergic side effects than with amitriptyline. May cause mild pupillary dilation, which can lead to narrow angle glaucoma.
Lower doses and slower dose titration are recommended in hepatic impairment. Therapeutic antide- pressant effects occur in 7-21 days. Monitor for clinical worsening of depression and suicidal ide- ation/behavior following the initiation of therapy or after dose changes. Do not discontinue abruptly. Nortriptyline is a substrate for the CYP 450 1A2 and 2D6 drug-metabolizing enzymes. Use and dosing considerations have been recommended based on the following CYP 450 2D6 phenotypes:
Ultrarapid metabolizer: Use of alternative drug not metabolized by CYP 2D6. If use warranted, titrate to the highest target dose and monitor serum levels.
Intermediate metabolizer: Reduce recommended initial dose by 25% and monitor serum levels.
Poor metabolizer: Avoid use to prevent potential side effect and use alternative drug not metabolized by CYP 2D6. If use is warranted, reduce recommended initial dose by 50% and monitor serum levels.
Rifampin may increase the metabolism of nortriptyline.
Therapeutic nortriptyline levels for depression: 50-150 ng/mL. Recommended serum sampling time: obtain a single level 8 or more hours after an oral dose (following 4 days of continuous dosing for children and after 9-10 days for adults).

Long-acting pamoate salt (Zyprexa Relprevv) for schizophrenia (adult): see remarks and package insert for specific dosage based on established oral dosage.
Use with caution in cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, hypotensive conditions, diabetes/hyperglycemia, elevated serum lipids and cholesterol, paralytic ileus, hepatic impairment, seizure disorders, narrow angle glaucoma, and prostatic hypertrophy.
Medication exhibits anticholinergic effects.
Common side effects include orthostatic hypotension, peripheral edema, hypercholesterolemia, hyper- prolactinemia, appetite simulation, weight gain (greater in adolescents than adults; monitoring
is recommended), hypertriglyceridemia, constipation, xerostomia, akathisia, asthenia, dizziness, somnolence, tremor, and personality disorder. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome, dystonia, cognitive and motor impairment, tardive dyskinesia (irreversible with cumulative high doses), neutropenia, leukopenia, agranulocytosis, suicidal intent, acute pancreatitis, pulmonary embolism, increases in liver function tests (ALT, AST, GGT), DRESS, and hyperthermia have been reported.
Olanzapine is a major substate for CYP 450 1A2 and minor substrate for 2D6. It also is a weak inhibi- tor to CYP 450 1A2, 2C9/19. Do not use in combination with alcohol, benzodiazepines, or opiates due to increased risk for sedation and cardiopulmonary depression. Caution is also indicated
with anticholinergic agents (e.g., azelastine, glycopyrrolate), as olanzapine may enhance the anticholinergic effects. Use with QTc-prolonging medications may further increase the risk for QTc prolongation. Metoclopramide may enhance neurological side effects of olanzapine. Do not use oral disintegrating tablets in phenylketonuria.
T1/2: 37 hr for children and 21-54 hr for adults via PO route. Short-acting IM T1/2 in adults is similar to PO route but long-acting IM T1/2 is ~30 days in adults.
Maintenance treatment for bipolar I disorder and schizophrenia has not been systematically evalu- ated in adolescents. Therefore it is recommended to utilize the lowest dose to maintain efficacy and to reassess the need for maintenance treatment periodically for this age group.


OLANZAPINE continued
All oral dosages may be taken either with or without food. For orally disintegrating tabs, tablet must be placed in patient's mouth immediately after removing it from the foil pack (by peeling off the foil, not by pushing the tablet through the foil) and allowed to dissolve in saliva; then swallowed with or without liquids.
Zyprexa Relprevv (long-acting IM injection): post injection delirium and sedation syndrome have been reported with this dosage form. Patients must be observed by a health care provider at a health care facility for at least 3 hr after administration. The FDA REMS program requires prescrib- ers, healthcare facilities, and pharmacies to register with the Zyprexa Relprevv Patient Care Program at 1-877-772-9390 for use of this product.

Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, acute interstitial nephritis, and vitamin B12 deficiency (with prolonged use) have been reported. Fundic gland polyps has been associated with long-term use of PPIs. Has been associated with increased risk for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea.
Drug induces CYP 450 1A2 (decreases theophylline levels) and is also a substrate and inhibitor of CYP 2C19. Recommended dosage modification for ultrarapid metabolizers of CYP 2C19 is to increase the usual dose by threefold. Increases T1/2 of citalopram, diazepam, phenytoin, and warfarin. May decrease the effects of itraconazole, ketoconazole, clopidogrel, iron salts, and ampicillin esters. St. John's wort and rifampin may decrease omeprazole effects. May be used in combination with clarithromycin and amoxicillin for Helicobacter pylori infections. Omeprazole may interfere with serum chromogranin A (CgA) diagnostic test for neuroendocrine tumors; discontinue use at least 14 days prior to testing.
Bioavailability may be increased with hepatic dysfunction or in patients of Asian descent. Safety and efficacy for GERD in children <1 mo have not been established.
Administer all doses before meals. Administer 30 min prior to sucralfate. Capsules contain enteric- coated granules to ensure bioavailability. Do not chew or crush capsule. For doses unable to be divided by 10 mg, capsule may be opened and intact pellets may be administered in an acidic beverage (e.g., apple juice, cranberry juice) or applesauce. The extemporaneously compounded oral suspension product may be less bioavailable due to the loss of the enteric coating.

Data limited for use in children below 3 yr of age.
ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities, CHF, or bradyarrhyth- mias. Drug clearance is higher for surgical and cancer patients <18 yr as compared with adults. Clearance is slower for children 1-4 mo old compared with children >4-24 mo old.
Ondansetron is a substrate for CYP 450 1A2, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A3/4 drug metabolizing enzymes. It is likely that the inhibition/loss of one of the previously listed enzymes will be compensated by others and may result in insignificant changes to the elimination of ondansetron, which may be affected by CYP 450 enzyme inducers. Ultrarapid metabolizers of CYP 450 2D6 is associated with decreased response and use of an alternative drug not predominantly metabolized by CYP 2D6 (e.g., granisetron) is recommended. Follow theophylline, phenytoin, or warfarin levels closely, if used in combination. Use with apomorphine may result in profound hypotension and loss of consciousness and is contraindicated.
To administer the oral film dosage form (Zuplenz), film must be placed on top of patient's tongue, allowed to dissolve completely in 4-20 sec, and swallowed with or without liquid.

Prophylaxis of influenza (initiate therapy within 2 days of exposure; see remarks): Child 3 mo-<1 yr: 3 mg/kg/dose PO once daily; alternative dosage based on age:
3-5 mo: 20 mg PO once daily
6-11 mo: 25 mg PO once daily
Child 1-12 yr:

>40 kg: 75 mg PO once daily
=13 yr old and adult: 75 mg PO once daily for a minimum of 7 days and up to 6 wk; initiate therapy within 2 days of exposure.
Currently indicated for the treatment of influenza A and B strains. Use in children <1 yr of age has not been recommended due to concerns of excessive CNS penetration and fatalities in 7-day-old rats.
Nausea and vomiting generally occur within the first 2 days and are the most common adverse effects. Insomnia, vertigo, seizures, hypothermia, neuropsychiatric events (may result in fatal outcomes), arrhythmias, rash, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have also been reported. If the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is 10-30 mL/min, reduce treatment dose to 75 mg PO once daily
× 5 days for adults. (See Chapter 31.)
PROPHYLACTIC USE: Oseltamivir is not a substitute for annual flu vaccination. Safety and efficacy have been demonstrated for =6 wk of therapy; duration of protection lasts for as long as dosing is continued. Adjust prophylaxis dose if GFR is 10-30 mL/min by extending the dosage interval to once every other day.
Probenecid increases oseltamivir levels. Oseltamivir decreases the efficacy of the nasal influenza vaccine (live attenuated influenza vaccine, FluMist); avoid administration of vaccine within 2 wk before or 48 hr after oseltamivir administration unless medically indicated.
Dosage adjustments in hepatic impairment, severe renal disease, and dialysis have not been established for either treatment or prophylactic use. The safety and efficacy of repeated treatment or prophylaxis courses have not been evaluated. Doses may be administered with or without food.

Adult:
Adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures: Start with 600 mg PO once daily (consider using 900 mg if patient is receiving concomitant enzyme-inducing AEDs). Then gradually increase at weekly intervals in 600 mg/24 hr increments to the maintenance dose of 1200-2400 mg once daily.
Clinically significant hyponatremia may occur; generally seen within the first 3 mo of therapy. May also cause headache, dizziness, drowsiness, ataxia, fatigue, nystagmus, urticaria, diplopia, abnormal gait, and GI discomfort. About 25%-30% of patients with carbamazepine hypersensitivity will experience a cross reaction with oxcarbazepine.
Serious dermatologic reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome [SJS] and TEN), multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., DRESS), bone marrow depression, osteoporosis, pancreatitis, folic acid deficiency, hypothyroidism, rare cases of anaphylaxis and angioedema, and suicidal behavior or ideation have been reported. Increased risk for severe dermatologic reactions (e.g., SJS and TEN) has been associated with the HLA- B*1502 (prevalent among persons of Asian descent) alleles.

O
OXCARBAZEPINE continued
Inhibits CYP 450 2C19 and induces CYP 450 3A4/5 drug metabolizing enzymes. Carbamazepine, cyclosporine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, valproic acid and verapamil may decrease oxcar- bazepine levels. Oxcarbazepine may increase phenobarbital and phenytoin levels. Oxcarbazepine can decrease the effects of oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, felodipine, and lamotrigine.
If GFR <30 mL/min, adjust dosage by administering 50% of the normal starting dose (max. dose: 300 mg/24 hr) followed by a slower than normal increase in dose if necessary (see Chapter 31). No dosage adjustment is required in mild/moderate hepatic impairment. Use is not recommended in severe hepatic impairment due to lack of information.
Extended release and immediate release products are not bioequivalent, as higher doses of the extended release product may be necessary. Doses may be administered with or without food.

Use with caution in hepatic or renal disease, hyperthyroidism, GE reflux, IBD, concurrent use of bisphosphonates, or cardiovascular disease. Anticholinergic side effects may occur, including drowsiness, confusion, and hallucinations. Contraindicated in glaucoma, GI obstruction, megacolon, myasthenia gravis, severe colitis, hypovolemia, and GU obstruction. Memory impairment, angioedema, and QT-interval prolongation have been reported. Oxybutynin is a CYP 450 3A4 substrate; inhibitors and inducers of CYP 450 3A4 may increase and decrease the effects of oxybutynin, respectively. May antagonize the effects of metoclopramide.
Dosage adjustments for the extended-release dosage form are at weekly intervals. The extended- release tablets should not be crushed, chewed, or divided.

Adolescent (=50 kg) and adult: 5-10 mg Q4-6 hr PRN PO; see remarks for use of controlled-release tablets.
There is a potential for abuse; CNS and respiratory depression, increased ICP, histamine release, constipation, and GI distress may occur. Use with caution in severe renal impairment (increases T1/2) and mild/moderate hepatic dysfunction (use of one-third to one-half of usual dose has been recommended). Naloxone is the antidote. See Chapter 6 for equianalgesic dosing. Check dosages of acetaminophen or aspirin when using combination products (e.g., Percocet, Percodan). Oxycodone is metabolized by the CYP 450 3A4 (major) and 2D6 (minor) isoenzyme.
When controlled-released tablets (e.g., Oxycontin) are being used, determine patient's total 24-hr requirement should be determined and divided by 2 to administer on a Q12 hr dosing interval. Oxycontin 80-mg tablet is USED ONLY for opioid-tolerant patients; this strength can cause fatal respiratory depression in opioid-naive patients. Controlled-release dosage form should not be used as a PRN analgesic and must be swallowed whole.
Pregnancy category changes to D if used for prolonged periods or in high doses at term.
The FDA has assigned a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for opioid analgesia; see www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG. The REMS strongly encourages the (1) completion of a REMS-compliant education program; (2) counsel patients/caregivers on prescription safe use, risks, storage, and disposal; (3) emphasize the importance of reading the medication guide provided by pharmacists at all times; and (4) consider other methods for improving patient, household, and community safety.

Injection, solution: 100 mg/mL (0.5, 1 mL; single use); contains glycine and histidine.

Following recommendations are from Pediatrics 2014;134(2):415-420.
Candidates for recommended use:
<12 mo of age (one of the following):
Born at =28-wk gestation; OR
With chronic lung disease (CLD) of prematurity (<32-wk gestation requiring >21% oxygen for at least 28 days after birth); OR
With hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease
<24 mo of age:
Born at =32-wk gestation with CLD requiring medical therapy (e.g., =28 days of supplemental oxygen, bronchodilator, diuretics, or chronic steroids) within 6 mo prior to start of RSV season.
Candidates for consideration:
<12 mo of age (one of the following):
With congenital airway abnormalities or neuromuscular disorders that decrease ability to manage airway secretions; OR
With cystic fibrosis with clinical evidence of CLD and/or nutritional compromise
=24 mo of age (one of the following):
With cystic fibrosis with severe lung disease (previous pulmonary exacerbation in first year of life
or abnormal chest x-ray) or weight for length less than the 10th percentile; OR Profoundly immunocompromised; OR
Undergoing cardiac transplantation during RSV season
DOSE:
=24 mo old: 15 mg/kg/dose IM Q monthly just prior to and during the RSV season. Maximum of five doses per RSV season is recommended by the AAP. Therapy should be discontinued if child
experiences breakthrough RSV hospitalization.
RSV season typically November through April in the northern hemisphere but may begin earlier or persist later in certain communities. IM is currently the only route of administration, so use with caution in patients with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder. The following adverse effects have been reported at slightly higher incidences when compared with placebo: rhinitis, rash, pain, increased liver enzymes, pharyngitis, cough, wheeze, diarrhea, vomiting, conjunctivitis, and anemia. Rare acute hypersensitivity reactions have been reported (first or subsequent doses).
Does not interfere with the response to routine childhood vaccines. May interfere with immunologic- based RSV diagnostic tests (some antigen detection-based assays and viral culture assays) but not with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays.
Palivizumab is currently indicated for RSV prophylaxis in high-risk infants only. Efficacy and safety have not been demonstrated for treatment of RSV.
Cardiopulmonary bypass and ECMO will significantly reduce serum concentrations; administer a dose immediately after the bypass procedure or ECMO even if it is <1 mo from the previous dose.
Each dose should be administered IM in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. It is recommended to divide doses with total injection volumes >1 mL. Avoid injection in the gluteal muscle because of risk for damage to the sciatic nerve.

Child <4 yr: 1000 U lipase/kg/meal
Child =4 yr and adult: 500 U lipase/kg/meal
Max. dose (child-adult): 2500 U lipase/kg/meal, or 10,000 U lipase/kg/24 hr, or 4000 U lipase/g fat/24 hr.
Total daily dose should include approximately three meals and two to three snacks per day. Snack doses are approximately half of meal doses, depending on the amount of fat and food consumed.
May cause occult GI bleeding, allergic reactions to porcine proteins, hyperuricemia, and hyperuricosuria with high doses. Dose should be titrated to eliminate diarrhea and to minimize steatorrhea. Do not chew microspheres or microtabs. Concurrent administration with H2 antagonists or gastric acid pump inhibitors may enhance enzyme efficacy. Doses higher than 6000 U lipase/kg/meal have been associated with colonic strictures in children
<12 yr. Nonenteric coated dosage forms (e.g., powder and tablet) are not preferred, owing to potential GI mucosal ulceration. Patients who are unable to swallow capsules intact may mix the contents with small amount of acidic soft foods (pH =4.5; such as applesauce) and swallow immediately after mixing.
Avoid use of generic pancreatic enzyme products because they been associated with treatment fail- ures. Products not approved by the FDA are no longer allowed to be distributed in the United States.
Patients requiring enzyme supplementation who receive enteral feeding via a feeding tube may alternatively use a digestive enzyme cartridge (RELiZORB).

May interfere with serum chromogranin A (CgA) diagnostic test for neuroendocrine tumors; discon- tinue use at least 14 days prior to testing. False-positive test for urine cannabinoid screen may occur.
Drug is a substrate for CYP 450 2C19 (major), 2D6 (minor), and 3A3/4 (minor) isoenzymes. Recommended dosage modification for ultrarapid metabolizers of CYP 2C19 is to increase the usual dose by fivefold. May decrease the absorption of itraconazole, ketoconazole, iron salts, and ampicillin esters. May increase the effect/toxicity of methotrexate.
Children 1-2 yr of age have demonstrated more rapid clearance of pantoprazole in pharmacokinetic studies; this age group may require higher doses. All oral doses may be taken with or without food. Do not crush or chew tablets. The extemporaneously compounded oral suspension may be less bioavailable owing to the loss of the enteric coating. Granules for delayed-release oral suspension product may be mixed with 5 mL apple juice (administer immediately followed by rinsing container with more apple juice), or sprinkled on 1 teaspoonful of apple sauce (administer within 10 min); see package insert for NG administration.
For IV infusion, doses may be administered over 15 min at a concentration of 0.4-0.8 mg/mL or over 2 min at a concentration of 4 mg/mL. Midazolam and zinc are not compatible with the IV dosage form. Parenteral routes other than IV are not recommended.

Use with caution in patients with history of seizures, renal or hepatic impairment, cardiac disease, suicidal concerns, mania/hypomania, concurrent use with other serotonergic drugs (e.g., triptans, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, amphetamines, or St. John's Wort), and diuretic use. Patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment should initiate therapy at 10 mg/24 hr and increase dose as needed up to a max. of 40 mg/24 hr.
Common side effects include anxiety, nausea, anorexia, and decreased appetite. Monitor for clinical worsening of depression and suicidal ideation/behavior following the initiation of therapy or after dose changes. Stevens-Johnson syndrome has been reported.
Paroxetine is an inhibitor and substrate for CYP 450 2D6. Ultrametabolizers of CYP 2D6 should avoid use of paroxetine and use an alternative medication not metabolized by this enzyme system. A 50% initial dose reduction for poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers has been recommended. May increase the effects/toxicity of tricyclic antidepressants, theophylline, and warfarin. May decrease the effects
of tamoxifen. Cimetidine, ritonavir, MAO inhibitors (fatal serotonin syndrome), dextromethorphan, phenothiazines, and type 1C antiarrhythmics may increase the effect/toxicity of paroxetine.
  Weakness, hyperreflexia, and poor coordination have been reported when taken with sumatriptan.
Do not discontinue therapy abruptly; may cause sweating, dizziness, confusion, and tremor. May be taken with or without food.

Loading dose (all ages): 20 mg/kg IV; max. dose: 1500 mg/24 hr
Maintenance for seizure disorders (initiate 12 hr after administration of loading dose):
Neonate: start with 5 mg/kg/24 hr PO/IV ÷ Q12 hr; usual range 4-8 mg/kg/24 hr PO/IV ÷ Q8-12 hr.
Infant/child: start with 5 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ BID-TID PO/IV; usual dose range (doses divided BID-TID):
6 mo-3 yr: 8-10 mg/kg/24 hr
4-6 yr: 7.5-9 mg/kg/24 hr
7-9 yr: 7-8 mg/kg/24 hr
10-16 yr: 6-7 mg/kg/24 hr
Note: Use once daily-BID dosing with extended release caps.
Adult: Start with 100 mg/dose Q8 hr IV/PO and carefully titrate (if needed) by 100 mg increments Q2-4 wk to 300-600 mg/24 hr (or 6-7 mg/kg/24 hr) ÷ Q8-24 hr IV/PO.
Contraindicated in patients with heart block or sinus bradycardia; those who are receiving delavirdine (decrease virologic response); and history of hydantoin hypersensitivity. Use with caution in patients with pacemakers or cardiac dysrhythmias because of its class IB antiarrhythmic properties. IM administration is not recommended because of erratic absorption and pain at injection site; consider fosphenytoin. Side effects include gingival hyperplasia, hirsutism, dermatitis, blood dyscrasia, ataxia, lupus-like and Stevens-Johnson syndromes, lymphadenopathy, liver damage, and nystagmus. Suicidal behavior or ideation, bradycardia, cardiac arrest, and multiorgan hypersensitivity (DRESS) have been reported. An increased risk for serious skin reactions (e.g., TEN and Stevens-Johnson) may occur in patients with the HLA-B*1502 allele; do not use this medication in individuals who carry this genotype.
Many drug interactions: levels may be increased by cimetidine, chloramphenicol, INH, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, etc. Levels may be decreased by some antineoplastic agents. Phenytoin induces hepatic microsomal enzymes (CYP 450 1A2, 2C8/9/19, and 3A3/4), leading to decreased effective- ness of oral contraceptives, fosamprenavir (used without ritonavir), quinidine, valproic acid, theophylline, and other substrates to the previously listed CYP 450 hepatic enzymes. May increase levels of amprenavir when administered with fosamprenavir and ritonavir. May cause resistance to neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (e.g., pancuronium, vecuronium, rocuronium, and cisatracurium) and decrease concentrations of T4 and T3 (typically without clinical hypothyroidism).
The following initial maintenance dose modifications for HLA-B*1502 allele noncarriers and CYP 450 2C9 phenotypes have been recommended:
CYP 2C9 intermediate metabolizer: 25% reduction with therapeutic drug monitoring CYP 2C9 poor metabolizer: 50% reduction with therapeutic drug monitoring
Ideal body weight should be used for calculating dosages. Suggested dosing intervals for specific oral dosage forms: extended release caps (once daily-BID); chewable tablets, and oral suspension (TID). Oral absorption reduced in neonates. T1/2 is variable (7-42 hr) and dose dependent. Drug is highly protein bound; free fraction of drug will be increased in patients with hypoalbuminemia.
For seizure disorders, therapeutic levels: 10-20 mg/L (free and bound phenytoin) OR 1-2 mg/L (free only). Monitor free phenytoin levels in hypoalbuminemia or renal insufficiency. Recommended serum sampling times: trough level (PO/IV) within 30 min prior to the next scheduled dose; peak or postload level (IV) 1 hr after the end of IV infusion. Steady state is usually achieved after 5-10 days of continuous dosing. For routine monitoring, measure trough.
IV push/infusion rate: Not to exceed 0.5 mg/kg/min in neonates, or 1 mg/kg/min infants, children, and adults with maximum of 50 mg/min; may cause cardiovascular collapse. Consider fosphe- nytoin in situations of tenuous IV access and risk for extravasation.

PIPERACILLIN WITH TAZOBACTAM continued
All doses based on piperacillin component.
Child and adolescent (IV): Severe infections (shortening the dosing interval to Q6 hr and lengthening the dose administration time to 4 hr (see remarks) may enhance the pharmacodynamic properties): 2-9 mo: 80 mg/kg/dose Q6-8 hr
>9 mo, child, and adolescent: 100 mg/kg/dose Q6-8 hr
Max. dose (all ages): 16 g/24 hr

Cystic fibrosis (antipseudomonal; see remarks):
All ages: 350-600 mg/kg/24 hr IV ÷ Q4-6 hr; max. dose: 24 g/24 hr.
Tazobactam is a ß-lactamase inhibitor, thus extending the spectrum of piperacillin. Like other penicillins, CSF penetration occurs only with inflamed meninges. GI disturbances, pruritus, rash, and headaches are common. Abnormal platelet aggregation and prolonged bleeding, serious skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson, DRESS, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, and TEN) have been reported. Cystic fibrosis patients have an increased risk for fever and rash. Increases in renal failure risk (in critically ill adults) and incidence of acute kidney injury (in combination with IV vancomycin) have been reported.
Coagulation parameters should be tested more frequently and monitored regularly with high doses of heparin, warfarin, or other drugs affecting blood coagulation or thrombocyte function. May falsely decrease ami- noglycoside serum levels if the drugs are infused close to one another; allow a minimum of 2 hr between infusions to prevent this interaction. May prolong the neuromuscular blockade effects of vecuronium.
Prolonging the dose administration time to 4 hr will maximize the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties by prolonging the time of drug concentration above the MIC; especially for pathogens with piperacillin MICs of 8-16 mCg/mL. Adjust dose in renal impairment, (see Chapter 31).

Alternative dosing: Start at 1 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q8 hr PO. If tolerated after 1 day, increase dose to 2 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q8 hr PO
Contraindicated in asthma, Raynaud syndrome, heart failure, and heart block. Not indicated for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies. Use with caution in presence of obstructive lung disease, diabetes mellitus, or renal or hepatic disease. May cause hypoglycemia, hypotension, nausea, vomiting, depression, weakness, impotence, bronchospasm, and heart block. Cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson, TEN, exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, and urticaria have been reported. Acute hypertension has occurred after insulin-induced hypoglycemia in patients on propranolol.
Therapeutic levels for beta-blockade: 50-100 ng/mL; ventricular arrhythmia: 40-85 ng/mL. Drug is metabolized by CYP 450 1A2, 2C18, 2C19 and 2D6 isoenzymes. Concurrent administration with barbitu- rates, indomethacin, or rifampin may cause decreased activity of propranolol. Concurrent administration with cimetidine, hydralazine, flecainide, quinidine, chlorpromazine, or verapamil may lead to increased activity of propranolol. Avoid IV use of propranolol with calcium channel blockers; may increase effect of calcium channel blocker. Use with amiodarone may increase negative chronotropic effects.
For infantile hemangioma, monitor BP and HR 2 hr after initiating therapy and after dose increases. To reduce risk of hypoglycemia, administer doses during or right after a feeding; hold doses if child is not eating or is vomiting. Infants <6 mo must be fed every 4 hr. Common adverse effects (>10%) reported in clinical trials with Hemangeol include sleep disorders, aggravated respiratory tract infections (e.g., bronchitis and bronchiolitis) associated with cough/fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. Readjust dose periodically with changes (increases) in child's body weight.
Successful use in infantile hepatic hemangiomas has also been reported. Pregnancy category changes to "D" if used in second or third trimesters.

Avoid use in patients with history of cardiac arrhythmias or prolonged QTc syndrome, concurrent medications that can prolong the QTc interval, and alcohol use. Use with caution in hypovolemia and diabetes mellitus.
Suicidal ideation/behavior or worsening depression may occur especially in children and young adults during the first few months of therapy or during dosage changes.
Common side effects in children include hypertension, hyperglycemia, hyperprolactinemia, and significant weight gain. Other common side effects include orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, abdominal pain, GI disturbances, increase appetite, xerostomia, increase serum transaminases, EPS, headache, dizziness, agitation, and fatigue.
Anaphylactic reactions, DRESS, SJS, TEN, SIADH, cardiomyopathy, priapism, DKA, pancreatitis, eosinophilia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, neutropenia, cataracts, hypothyroidism, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and seizures have been reported. Anticholinergic side effects (e.g., constipa- tion, urinary retention) may occur due to norquetiapine, its active metabolite.
Continued


QUETIAPINE continued
Do not abruptly discontinue medication as acute withdrawal symptoms occur. Dosage adjustment in hepatic impairment may be necessary as it is primarily hepatically metabolized. Quetiapine is a major substrate for CYP 450 3A4 and minor substrate for 2D6. Opioids and other CNS depressants may enhance CNS depressant effects. Carbamazepine may decrease the effects of quetiapine.
Quetiapine may decrease dopamine agonist effects (e.g., anti-parkinson agents) but may enhance the anticholinergic and QTc prolongation effects to those medications processing these risks.
Always check for drug interactions as effects can be mild to severe.
Non-extended release dosage forms may be administered with or without food. Extended-release tabs must be swallowed whole and administered preferably in the evening without food (a light meal
of =300 calories is allowed). May convert patients from immediate-release to extended-release
tablets at the equivalent total daily dose and administer once daily; individual dosage adjustments may be necessary.


As gluconate (62% quinidine):
Slow-release tabs: 324 mg
As sulfate (83% quinidine):
Tabs: 200, 300 mg
Oral suspension: 10 mg/mL 
Equivalents: 200 mg sulfate = 267 mg gluconate
NOTE: The intravenous dosage form is no longer available in the United States. Contact the CDC Marlaria Hotline at (770) 488-7788 or (855) 856-4713 for an alternative therapy.
Child (as sulfate): 15-60 mg/kg/24 hr 24 hr PO ÷ Q 6 hr; max. dose: 2400 mg/24 hr.
Adult:
As sulfate: 100-600 mg/dose PO Q 4-6 hr. Begin at 200 mg/dose and titrate to desired effect.
As gluconate: 324-972 mg PO Q 8-12 hr.
Malaria:
Child and adult (give intravenously as gluconate; see remarks):
Loading dose: 10 mg/kg/dose IV (max. dose: 600 mg) over 1-2 hr followed by maintenance dose. Omit or decrease load if patient has received quinine or mefloquine.
Maintenance dose: 0.02 mg/kg/min IV as continuous infusion until oral therapy can be initiated. If more than 48 hr of intravenous therapy is required, reduce dose by 30%-50%.
Test dose is given to assess for idiosyncratic reaction to quinidine. Toxicity indicated by increase of QRS interval by =0.02 sec (skip dose or stop drug). May cause gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, hypotension, tinnitus, TTP, rash, heart block and blood dyscrasias. When used alone, may cause 1:1 conduction in atrial flutter leading to ventricular fibrillation. Patients may develop idiosyncratic ventricular tachycardia with low levels, especially when therapy is being initiated.

Q
QUINIDINE continued
Quinidine is a substrate of CYP 450 3A3/4 and 3A5-7 enzymes, and an inhibitor of CYP 450 2D6 and 3A3/4 enzymes. Can cause increase in digoxin levels. Quinidine potentiates the effect of neuro- muscular blocking agents, beta blockers, anticholinergics, and warfarin. Amiodarone, antacids, delavirdine, diltiazem, grapefruit juice, saquinavir, ritonavir, verapamil, or cimetidine may enhance the drug's effect. Barbiturates, phenytoin, cholinergic drugs, nifedipine, sucralfate, or rifampin may reduce quinidine's effect. Use with caution in renal insufficiency (15%-25% of drug is eliminated unchanged in the urine), myocardial depression, sick sinus syndrome, G6PD deficiency, and hepatic dysfunction.
Therapeutic levels (antiarrhythmic): 3-7 mg/L. Recommended serum sampling times at steady state: trough level obtained within 30 min prior to the next scheduled dose after 1-2 days of continuous dosing (steady state).
MALARIA USE: Continuous monitoring of electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and serum glucose is recommended, especially in pregnant women and young children.

VREF endocarditis:
Child and adult: 7.5 mg/kg/dose IV Q 8 hr for at least 8 weeks
Not active against Enterococcus faecalis. Use with caution in hepatic impairment; dosage reduction may be necessary. Most common side effects include pain, burning, inflammation and edema at the intravenous infusion site, thrombophlebitis, and thrombosis, GI disturbances, rash, arthralgia, myalgia, increased liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, and headache. Dose frequency reductions (Q 8 hr-Q 12 hr) or discontinuation can improve severe cases of arthralgia and myalgia. Use total body weight for obese patients when calculating dosages.
Drug is an inhibitor to the CYP 450 3A4 isoenzyme. Avoid use with CYP 450 3A4 substrates, which can prolong QTc interval. May increase the effects/toxicity of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, delavirdine, nevirapine, indinavir, ritonavir, diazepam, midazolam, carbamazepine, methylpred- nisolone, vinca alkaloids, docetaxel, paclitaxel, quinidine and some calcium channel blockers.
Pediatric (<16 yr old) pharmacokinetic studies are incomplete. Reduce dose for patients with hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A or B).
Drug is compatible with D5W and incompatible with saline and heparin. Infuse each dose over 1 hr using the following max. IV concentrations: peripheral line: 2 mg/mL, central line: 5 mg/mL. If injection site reaction occurs, dilute infusion to <1 mg/mL.

Hyperuricemia (all ages): 0.1-0.2 mg/kg/dose (rounded down to the nearest whole 1.5 mg multiple) IV over 30 min × 1. Patients generally respond to one dose but if needed dose may be repeated Q 24 hr for up to four additional doses.
Contraindicated in G6PD deficiency (risk for acute hemolytic anemia) or history of hypersensitivity, hemolytic reactions, or methemoglobinemia with rasburicase. Use with caution in asthma, allergies, hypersensitivity with other medications, and children <2 yr of age (decreased efficacy and increased risk for rash, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever).
Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, discomfort, diarrhea, constipation, mucositis, fever, and rash. Serious and fatal hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in <1% of patients, including anaphylaxis, and can occur at any time; discontinue use immediately and permanently.
During therapy, uric acid blood samples must be sent to the laboratory immediately. Blood should be collected in prechilled tubes containing heparin, and placed in an ice-water bath to avoid potential falsely low uric acid levels (degradation of plasma uric acid occurs in the presence of rasburicase at room temperature). Centrifugation in a precooled centrifuge (4°C) is indicated. Plasma samples must be assayed within 4 hr of sample collection.

RIBAVIRIN continued

ORAL RIBAVIRIN: Contraindicated in pregnancy, significant or unstable cardiac disease, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatic decompensation (Child-Pugh score >6; class B or C), hemoglobinopathies, and creatinine clearance <50 mL/min. Use with caution in preexisting cardiac disease, pulmonary disease and sarcoidosis. Anemia (most common), insomnia, depression, irritability, and suicidal behavior (higher in adolescent and pediatric patients) have been reported with the oral route.
Combination therapy with peginterferon for Hep C is no longer recommended due to poor efficacy. Tinnitus, hearing loss, vertigo, severe hypertriglyceridemia, and homicidal ideation have been reported in combination with interferon. Pancytopenia has been reported in combination with interferon and azathioprine. Increased risk for hepatic decompensation with cirrhotic chronic hepa- titis C patients treated with a interferons or with HIV coinfection receiving HAART and interferon alfa-2a. Growth inhibition (delays in weight and height increases) was observed in children (5-17 years old) receiving combination therapy for up to 48 weeks.
May decrease the effects of zidovudine, stavudine; and increase risk for lactic acidosis with nucleo- side analogues. Reduce or discontinue dosage for toxicity as follows:
Patient with no cardiac disease:
Hgb < 10 g/dL and =8.5 g/dL:
Child: 12 mg/kg/dose PO once daily; may further reduce to 8 mg/kg/dose PO once daily
Adult: 600 mg PO once daily (capsules or solution) or 200 mg PO QAM and 400 mg PO QPM (tablets)
  Hgb < 8.5 g/dL: Discontinue therapy permanently. Patient with cardiac disease:
=2 mg/dL decrease in Hgb during any 4-week period during therapy:
Child: 12 mg/kg/dose PO once daily; may further reduce to 8 mg/kg/dose PO once daily (monitor weekly)
Adult: 600 mg PO once daily (capsules or solution) or 200 mg PO QAM and 400 mg PO QPM (tablets)
Hgb < 12 g/dL after 4 weeks of reduced dose: Discontinue therapy permanently
INHALED RIBAVIRIN: Use of ribavirin for RSV is controversial and not routinely indicated. Aerosol therapy may be considered for selected infants and young children at high risk for serious RSV disease (see most recent edition of the AAP Redbook). Most effective if begun early in course of RSV infection; generally in the first 3 days. May cause worsening respiratory distress, rash,
conjunctivitis, mild bronchospasm, hypotension, anemia and cardiac arrest. Avoid unnecessary occupational exposure to ribavirin due to its teratogenic effects. Drug can precipitate in the respiratory equipment.

Use in combination with HIV antiretroviral agents: see product information for dosage recommendations.
Should not be used for MAC prophylaxis with active TB. May cause GI distress, discoloration of skin and body fluids (brown-orange color) and marrow suppression. Rash, eosinophilia, and bronchospasm have been reported. Use with caution in renal and liver impairment. Adjust dose in renal impairment (see Chapter 31). May permanently stain contact lenses. Uveitis can occur when using high doses (>300 mg/24 hr in adults) in combination with macrolide antibiotics.
Rifabutin is an inducer of CYP 450 3A enzyme and is structurally similar to rifampin (similar drug interactions, see Rifampin). Clarithromycin, fluconazole, itraconazole, nevirapine and protease inhibitors increase rifabutin levels. Efavirenz may decrease rifabutin levels. May decrease effectiveness of dapsone, delavirdine, nevirapine, amprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir, itraconazole, warfarin, oral contraceptives, digoxin, cyclosporine, ketoconazole and narcotics.
Doses may be administered with food if patient experiences GI intolerance.

Max. dose (all ages): 1200 mg/24 hr.
Never use as monotherapy except when used for prophylaxis. Patients with latent tuberculosis infection should NOT be treated with rifampin and pyrazinamide because of the risk of severe liver injury. Use is NOT recommended in porphyria. Use with caution in diabetes.
May cause GI irritation, allergy, headache, fatigue, ataxia, muscle weakness, confusion, fever, hepatitis, transient LFT abnormalities, blood dyscrasias, interstitial nephritis, and elevated BUN and uric acid. Causes red discoloration of body secretions such as urine, saliva and tears (which can permanently stain contact lenses). Bleeding and vitamin K-dependent coagulation disorders have been reported.
Induces several hepatic enzymes and transporters (CYP 450 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4; UGT1A1,
P-glycoprotein, and OATP1B1/1B3), which may decrease plasma concentration of digoxin, corticoste- roids, buspirone, benzodiazepines, fentanyl, calcium channel blockers, ß blockers, cyclosporine, tacro- limus, itraconazole, ketoconazole, oral anticoagulants, barbiturates, and theophylline. May reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives and anti-retroviral agents (protease inhibitors and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors). Use is contraindicated with praziquantel due to decreased praziqu- antel levels; rifampin should be discontinued 4 weeks prior to initiating praziquantel and rifampin can be restarted one day after completion of praziquantel. Hepatotoxicity is a concern when used in combination with pyrazinamide and ritonavir-boosted saquinavir (use is contraindicated).

R
RIMANTADINE continued
Preferred over amantadine for influenza due to lower incidence of adverse events. Individuals immunized with live attenuated influenza vaccine (e.g., FluMist) should not receive rimantadine prophylaxis for 14 days after the vaccine. Chemoprophylaxis does not interfere with immune response to inactivated influenza vaccine.
May cause GI disturbance, xerostoma, dizziness, headache and urinary retention. CNS disturbances are less than with amantadine. Contraindicated in amantadine hypersensitivity. Use with caution in renal or hepatic insufficiency; dosage reduction may be necessary. A dosage reduction of 50% has been recommended in severe hepatic or renal impairment. Subjects with severe renal impair- ment have been reported to have an 81% increase in systemic exposure.

Adolescent (13-17 yr): No data are available to support long-term use of >8 wk.
PO: Start with 0.5 mg once daily (QAM or QHS). If needed, increase dose at intervals =24 hr in incre- ments of 0.5 to 1 mg/24 hr, as tolerated, to a recommended dose of 3 mg/24 hr. Although efficacy has been demonstrated between 1-6 mg/24 hr, no additional benefit and greater side effects were seen above 3 mg/24 hr. Doses >6 mg/24 hr have not been studied.
Adult:
PO: Start with 1 mg BID on day 1; if tolerated, increase to 2 mg BID on day 2 and to 3 mg BID there- after. Dosage increases or decreases of 1-2 mg can be made on a weekly basis if needed. Usual effective dose: 2-8 mg/24 hr. Doses above 16 mg/24 hr have not been evaluated.
IM: Start with 25 mg Q 2 wk; if no response, dose may be increased to 37.5 mg or 50 mg at 4-week intervals. Max. IM dose: 50 mg Q 2 wk. PO risperidone should also be administered with the initial IM dose and continued × 3 weeks and discontinued to provide adequate plasma concentrations during the initial IM dosing period.
Use with caution in cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, renal or hepatic impairment (dose reduction necessary), hypothermia or hyperthermia, seizures, breast cancer or other prolactin dependent tumors, and dysphagia. Common side effects include abdominal pain and other GI disturbances, arthralgia, anxiety, dizziness, headache, insomnia, somnolence (use QHS dosing), EPS, cough, fever, pharyngitis, rash, rhinitis, sexual dysfunction, tachycardia, and weight gain. Weight gain, somnolence, and fatigue were common side effects reported in the autism studies. Priapism, QTc prolongation, hypothermia, sleep apnea syndrome, sleep walking, ileus, urinary retention, diabetes mellitus, and hypoglycemia have been reported in post marketing reports. Very rare cases of anaphylaxis have been reported with use of the IM dosage form in patients who have previously tolerated the oral dosage form.
In the presence of severe renal or hepatic impairment or risk for hypotension, the following adult dosing has been recommended: Start with 0.5 mg PO BID. Increase dose, if needed and tolerated, in increments no more than 0.5 mg BID. Increases to doses >1.5 mg BID should occur at intervals of at least 1 week; slower titration may be required in some patients.
Limited studies in pediatric related Tourette syndrome, schizophrenia, and aggressive behavior in psychiatric disorders are reported. Autistic disorder safety and efficacy in children <5 years of age have not been established. If therapy has been discontinued for a period of time, therapy should be reinitiated with the same initial titration regimen.
Drug is a CYP 450 2D6 and 3A4 isoenzyme substrate. Concurrent use of isoenzyme inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, cimetidine) and inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin, phe- nobarbital, phenytoin) may increase and decrease the effects of risperidone, respectively. Alcohol, CNS depressants, and St. John's wort may potentiate the drug's side effect. Risperidone may enhance the hypotensive effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists.
Oral dosage forms may be administered with or without food. Oral solution can be mixed in water, coffee, orange juice, or low-fat milk but is incompatible with cola or tea. Do not split or chew the orally disintegrating tablet. Use IM suspension preparation within 6 hr after reconstitution.

Injection: 10 mg/mL (5, 10 mL)
Use of a peripheral nerve stimulator to monitor drug effect is recommended. Infant:
IV: 0.5 mg/kg/dose; may repeat Q 20-30 min PRN
Child (3 mo-14 yr):
IV: 0.6 mg/kg/dose × 1; if needed, give maintenance doses of 0.075-0.125 mg/kg/dose Q20-30 min PRN when neuromuscular blockade returns to 25% of control. Alternatively, a maintenance continuous intravenous infusion may be used starting at 7-12 mCg/kg/min when neuromuscular blockade returns to 10% of control.
Adolescent and adult:
IV: Start with 0.6-1.2 mg/kg/dose × 1; if needed, maintenance doses at 0.1-0.2 mg/kg/dose
Q 20-30 min PRN. Alternatively, a maintenance continuous intravenous infusion may be used starting at 10-12 mCg/kg/min (range: 4-16 mCg/kg/min).


ROCURONIUM continued
Use with caution in hepatic impairment and history of anaphylaxis with other neuromuscular blocking agents. Hypertension, hypotension, arrhythmia, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, bronchospasm, wheezing, hiccups, rash, and edema at the injection site may occur. Myopathy after long-term use in an intensive care unit (ICU) and QT interval prolongation in pediatric patients receiving general anesthetic agents have been reported. Severe anaphylactic reactions and malignant hypothermia have been reported. Increased neuromuscular blockade may occur with concomitant use of aminoglycosides, clindamycin, tetracycline, magnesium sulfate, quinine, quinidine, succinylcholine and inhalation anesthetics (for continuous infusion, reduce infusion by 30%-50% at 45-60 min after intubating dose).
Caffeine, calcium, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenylephrine, azathioprine, and theophylline may reduce neuromuscular blocking effects.
Use must be accompanied by adequate anesthesia or sedation. Peak effects occur in 0.5-1 min for children and in 1-3.7 min for adults. Duration of action: 30-40 min in children and 20-94 min in adults (longer in geriatrics). Recovery time in children 3 months to 1 year of age is similar to that in adults. To prevent residual paralysis, extubate patient only after the patient has sufficiently recovered from neuromuscular blockade. In obese patients, use actual body weight for dosage calculation.

Tabs: 200, 400 mg
Oral suspension: 40 mg/mL (460 mL); contains parabens and propylene glycol
Child 1-<17 yr (see remarks): Start at 10 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ BID, then increase dose
by ~10 mg/kg/24 hr every other day up to the maximum targeted dose of 45 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ BID
not to exceed 3200 mg/24 hr.
Child =17 yr and adult: Start at 400-800 mg/24 hr PO ÷ BID, then increase dose by 400-800 mg/ 24 hr every other day up to the maximum targeted dose of 3200 mg/24 hr ÷ BID.
Use with concurrent valproate therapy: Use lower initial dosages; <10 mg/kg/24 hr for child 1-<17 yr and <400 mg/24 hr for =17 yr and adult.
Contraindicated in Familial short-QT syndrome. Use is not recommended in severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 10-15). Use with caution when taking other medications that can shorten the QT interval, performing tasks requiring mental alertness, and in mild/moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 5-9).
Common side effects include fatigue, blurred vision, diplopia, ataxia, dizziness, headache, somno- lence, nausea, vomiting and shortening of cardiac QT interval. Serious side effects of leukopenia, severe dermatologic reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome), multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., DRESS), and suicidal ideation have been reported.
Rufinamide is a weak inhibitor of CYP 450 2E1 and weak inducer of 3A4. May decrease levels/ effects of nifedipine, nimodipine, piperaquine, calcifediol, clozapine, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, triazolam, orlistat, and hormonal contraceptives. May increase the levels/effects of phenytoin and phenobarbital. Primidone, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine may decrease the levels/ effects of rufinamide. Whereas valproic acid may increase the levels/effects of rufinamide.
The effectiveness data for 1- to 4-year-old children is based on bridging pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety data as their PK and safety data are similar to children =4 years old and adults.
Consider dose adjustment for drug loss in patients receiving hemodialysis (rufinamide is dialyzable). For therapy discontinuation, reduce dose by ~25% every 2 days. Tablets may be crushed and all

Dry powder inhalation (DPI; Diskus): 50 mCg/inhalation (28, 60 inhalations); contains lactose
In combination with fluticasone: see Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol
Persistent asthma (see remarks):
=4 yr and adult: 1 inhalation (50 mCg) Q 12 hr
Prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm:
=4 yr and adult: 1 inhalation 30 to 60 min before exercise. Additional does should not be used for another 12 hr. Patients who are already using 12-hr dosing for persistent asthma should not use
additional salmeterol doses for this indication and use alternative therapy (e.g., albuterol) prior to exercise.
For long-term asthma control, should be used in combination with inhaled corticosteroids. Should not be used to relieve symptoms of acute asthma. It is long acting and has its onset of action in 10 to 20 min with a peak effect at 3 hr. May be used at QHS (1 inhalation of the dry powder inhaler [DPI]) for nocturnal symptoms. Salmeterol is a chronic medication and is not used in similar fashion to short-acting ß agonists (e.g., albuterol). Patients already receiving salmeterol every 12 hr should not use additional doses for prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm; consider alternative therapy. Asthma exacerbations or hospitalizations were reported to be lower when this medication was used with an inhaled corticosteroid.
WARNING: Long-acting ß-2-agonists as monotherapy increase the risks of asthma-related death and asthma-related hospitalizations. Monotherapy without concomitant use of an inhaled
corticosteroid is contraindicated in asthma. Use salmeterol only as additional therapy for patients not adequately controlled on other asthma-controller medications (e.g., low- to medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids) or whose disease severity clearly requires initiation of treatment with two maintenance therapies. Contraindicated in milk allergies; contains milk proteins.
Should not be used in conjunction with an inhaled, long-acting ß-2 agonist and is not a substitute
for inhaled or systemic corticosteroid. Use with strong CYP450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, HIV protease inhibitors, clarithromycin, itraconazole, nefazodone, and telithromycin) is not recommended due to risk for cardiovascular adverse events (e.g., QTc prolongation, tachycardia). Salmeterol is a CYP450 3A4 substrate.
Proper patient education is essential. Use with caution in hepatic impairment. Side effects are similar to those of albuterol. Hypertension and arrhythmias have been reported. See Chapter 24 for recommendations for asthma controller therapy.

Antiemetic prior to surgery: Apply patch behind the ear the evening before prior to surgery. Remove
patch 24 hr after surgery.
Antiemetic prior to cesarean section: Apply patch behind the ear 1 hr prior surgery to minimize infant exposure. Remove patch 24 hr after surgery.
Toxicities similar to those of atropine. Contraindicated in closed-angle glaucoma and hypersensitivity to belladonna alkaloids. Use with caution in hepatic or renal dysfunction, GI and urinary disorders (discontinue use if there is difficulty in urination), cardiac disease, seizures, or psychosis. May cause dry mouth, drowsiness, and blurred vision.
Generalized rash and erythema may indicate hypersensitivity to the medication or other ingredients in the formulation.
Transdermal route should NOT be used in children under 12 yr of age. Drug withdrawal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, headache, and vertigo) have been reported following removal of transdermal patch in patients using the patch for more than 3 days. For perioperative use, the patch should be kept in place for 24 hr following surgery.
Concurrent use with medications with known CNS adverse reactions or have anticholinergic proper- ties may potentiate scopolamine's CNS effects. Use of this medication may delay the rate of orally administered drugs and will interfere with the gastric secretion test (discontinue use 10 days prior to testing).
REMOVE transdermal patch before undergoing an MRI; patch contains aluminum.

May increase dosage by 25 mg at weekly intervals up to a max. dose of 200 mg/24 hr.
Child =13 yr and adult: Start at 25-50 mg PO once daily. May increase dosage by 50 mg at weekly intervals up to a max. dose of 200 mg/24 hr.
Obesessive compulsive disorder (see remarks):
Child =6-12 yr: Start at 25 mg PO once daily. May increase dosage by 25 mg at 3- to 4-day intervals or by 50 mg at 7-day intervals up to a max. dose of 200 mg/24 hr.
Child =13 yr and adult: Start at 50 mg PO once daily. May increase dosage by 50 mg at weekly
intervals up to max. dose of 200 mg/24 hr.
Drug is contraindicated in combination (or within 14 days of discontinuing use) with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor (e.g., linezolid or intravenous methylene blue) or pimozide (increases adverse/toxic effects of pimozide). Use with caution in patients with abnormal bleeding, syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion, and hepatic or renal impairment. Adverse effects include nausea, diarrhea, tremor, and increased sweating. Hyponatremia, diabetes mellitus, rhabdomyolysis, trismus, and platelet dysfunction have been reported. A positive correlation with length of QTc interval and serum sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline levels has been reported.
Monitor for clinical worsening of depression and suicidal ideation/behavior following the initiation of therapy or after dose changes. Use during the late third trimester of pregnancy may increase risk for withdrawal symptoms and persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn.
Use with drugs that interfere with hemostasis (e.g., NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin) may increase risk for GI bleeds. Use with warfarin may increase PT. Inhibits the CYP 450 2D6 drug metabolizing enzyme. Serotonin syndrome may occur when taken with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., amitriptyline, amphetamines, buspirone, dihydroergotamine, sumatriptan, sympathomimetics).
Sertraline is a substrate for CYP 450 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4. Poor metabolizers of CYP 450 2C19 should initiate therapy at 50% of the recommended dosage and titrate to desired effect or consider using an alternative medication not predominantly metabolized by this enzyme. Ultrarapid 2C19 metabolizers should initiate therapy at the recommended starting dose and titrate to the recommended maintenance dosage or consider using a drug not predominantly metabolized by this enzyme.
Do not abruptly discontinue use; gradually taper dose (4-6 wk has been recommended) to reduce risk for withdrawal symptoms.
Mix oral concentrate solution with 4 oz of water, ginger ale, lemon/lime soda, lemonade, or orange juice. After mixing, a slight haze may appear; this is normal. This dosage form should be used cautiously in patients with latex allergy because the dropper contains dry natural rubber.

SILDENAFIL continued
Pulmonary hypertension:
Neonate (limited data from case reports and small clinical trials):
PO: Several dosages have been reported and have ranged from 0.5 to 3 mg/kg/dose
Q 6-12 hr PO. A single dose of ~0.3 mg/kg PO has been used in select patients to facilitate weaning from inhaled nitric oxide.
IV (case report from 4 neonates >34 wk gestation and <72 hr old): Start with 0.4 mg/kg/dose IV over 3 hr followed by a continuous infusion of 1.6 mg/kg/24 hr (0.067 mg/kg/hr) for up to
7 days.
Infant and child (limited data):
PO: Start at 0.25 mg/kg/dose Q 6 hr or 0.5 mg/kg/dose Q 8 hr; if needed, titrate dose up to
1-2 mg/kg/dose Q 6-8 hr. A single dose of ~0.4mg/kg PO has been used in select patients to facilitate weaning from inhaled nitric oxide.
Child 1-17 yr (higher doses and long-term use are associated with increased risk for mortality; see remarks).
PO:
=8-20 kg: 10 mg TID
>20-45 kg: 20 mg TID
>45 kg: 40 mg TID
Pulmonary arterial hypertension:
Adult:
PO: 20 mg TID (take at least 4-6 hr apart)
IV: 10 mg TID
Contraindicated with concurrent use of nitrates (e.g., nitroglycerin) and other nitric oxide donors; potentiates hypotensive effects. Use with caution in sepsis (high levels of cGMP may potentiate hypotension), hypotension, sickle cell anemia (use not established) and with concurrent CYP 450 3A4 inhibiting medications (see discussion that follows) and anti-hypertensive medications. Hepatic insufficiency or severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] <30 mL/min) significantly reduces sildenafil clearance.
Findings from the dose-ranging study in 1- to 17-yr-olds with pulmonary arterial hypertension found an association of increased mortality risk with long-term use (>2 yr). Headache, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), vomiting, and diarrhea were the most frequently reported side effect in this study. Optimal dosing based on age and body weight still needs to be determined. Hazard ratios for mortality were 3.95 (95% CI: 1.46-10.65) for high versus low doses and 1.92 (95% CI: 0.65-5.65) for medium versus low doses in follow-up study for those receiving therapy for
=3 yr. A subsequent extension open-label study on the same population for an additional 16 weeks
reported a greater hazard ratio for mortality with high- versus low-dose therapy (P = 0.007).
In adults, a transient impairment of color discrimination may occur; this effect could increase risk of severe retinopathy of prematurity in neonates. Common side effects reported in adults have included flushing, rash, diarrhea, indigestion, headache, abnormal vision, and nasal congestion. Hearing loss has been reported.
Sildenafil is substrate for CYP 450 3A4 (major) and 2C8/9 (minor). Azole antifungals, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, nicardipine, propofol, protease inhibitors, quinidine, verapamil, and grapefruit juice may increase the effects/toxicity of sildenafil. Bosentin, efavirenz, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John's wort, and high-fat meals may decrease sildenafil effects.






Contraindicated in premature infants and infants up to 2 mo of age due to concerns of kernicterus; also contraindicated in pregnancy (approaching term). Use with caution in G6PD and renal and hepatic impairment. Discard product if cream has darkened.
Significant systemic absorption may occur in severe burns. Adverse effects include pruritus, rash, bone marrow suppression, hemolytic anemia, hepatitis, interstitial nephritis, and life-threatening cutaneous reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis [TEN] and exfoliative dermatitis). Avoid contact with the eye. Dressing may be used but is not necessary. See Chapter 4 for more information.

SIROLIMUS continued
Adult (see remarks):
Patients at low/moderate immunologic risk:
In combination with cyclosporine (adjust dose to achieve desired trough blood levels):
<40 kg: 3 mg/m2/dose PO given once immediately after transplantation followed by 1 mg/m2/dose PO once on the next day
=40 kg: 6 mg PO once immediately after transplantation, followed by 2 mg PO once on the next day
Patients at high immunologic risk:
In combination with cyclosporine (withdrawal of cyclosporine is not recommended): 15 mg PO once immediately after transplantation, followed by 5 mg PO once on the next day. Adjust dose to achieve desired trough blood levels.
Increased susceptibility to infection and development of lymphoma may result from immunosuppression. Fatal bronchial anastomotic dehiscence has been reported in lung transplantation. Excess mortality, graft loss, and hepatic artery thrombosis have been reported in liver transplantation when used with tacrolimus. Patients with the greatest amount of urinary protein excretion prior to sirolimus conversion were those whose protein excretion increased the most after conversion. Increase risk of BK virus associated nephropathies have been reported. The following adverse effects have been reported when converting from a calcineurin inhibitor-based regimen to maintenance sirolimus:
Stable liver transplant: increased mortality
Kidney transplant: pneumonia, proteinuria, acute rejection, graft loss and death.
Monitor whole-blood trough levels (just prior to a dose at steady state); especially with pediatric patients; hepatic impairment; concurrent use of CYP 450 3A4 and/or P-gp inducers and inhibitors; and/or if cyclosporine dosage is markedly changed or discontinued. Steady-state is generally achieved after 5 to 7 days of continuous dosing. Interpretation will vary based on specific treat- ment protocol and assay methodology (HPLC vs immunoassay vs LC/MS/MS). Younger children may exhibit faster sirolimus clearance compared with adolescents.
Sirolimus is a substrate for CYP 450 3A4 and P-gp. Cyclosporine, diltiazem, protease inhibitors, erythromycin, grapefruit juice and other inhibitors of CYP 3A4 may increase the toxicity of siroli- mus. Phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St John's wort may decrease the effects of sirolimus. Strong inhibitors (e.g., azole antifungals and clarithromycin) and strong inducers (e.g., rifamycins) are not recommended.
Hypertension, peripheral edema, increase serum creatinine, dyspnea, epistaxis, headache, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, and arthralgia may occur. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), diabetes mellitus, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, ovarian cysts and menstrual disorders have been reported. Urinary tract infections have been reported in pediatric renal transplant patients with high immunologic risk.
Two milligrams of the oral solution have been demonstrated to be clinically equivalent to the 2-mg tablets. However, it is not known whether they are still therapeutically equivalent at higher doses. Reduce maintenance dosage by one-third in the presence of hepatic function impairment. Administer doses consistently with or without food. When administered with cyclosporine, give dose 4 hr after cyclosporine. Do not crush or split tablets. Measure the oral liquid dosage form
with an amber oral syringe and dilute in a cup with 60 mL of water or orange juice only. Take dose immediately after mixing, add/mix additional 120 mL diluent into the cup, and drink immediately after mixing.

Infant (>34 weeks' gestation up to 18 mo old): Nebulize 4 mL of 3% solution Q 2 hr for three doses followed by Q 4 hr for five doses followed by Q-6-hr dosing until discharge.
INTRANASAL USE: May be used as a nasal wash for sinuses, to restore moisture, to thin nasal secretions, or to relieve dry, crusted, and inflamed nasal membranes from colds, low humidity, allergies, nasal decongestant overuse, minor nose bleeds, and other irritations. Nasal administration instructions:
Nasal drops: tilt head back and hold bottle upside down.
Nasal spray: hold head in upright position and give short, firm squeezes into each nostril. Sniff deeply.
NEBULIZATION: Hypertonic solutions lowers sputum viscosity and enhances mucociliary clearance.
Cystic Fibrosis: Improves FEV1 and reduces pulmonary exacerbation frequency. May cause broncho- spasm, cough, pharyngitis, hemoptysis, and acute decline in pulmonary function (administer first dose in a medical facility). It is recommended to withhold therapy in the presence of massive hemoptysis.
Acute viral bronchiolitis: Reduces length of hospitalization when compared to normal saline. May cause acute bronchospasm and local irritation.





Injection: 100 mg sodium phenylacetate and 100 mg sodium benzoate per 1 mL (50 mL)
IV via central line (administered with IV arginine, continue infusion until ammonia levels are in the normal range): See Chapter 13 for dosing information.
Indicated for hyperammonemia due to enzyme deficiencies of the urea cycle (e.g., carbamoyl phosphate synthetase [CPS] and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency). Use with caution in renal and hepatic impairment. Significant amounts of sodium may be administered with prolonged durations of therapy. Ammonia clearance is most efficient with hemodialysis.
Side effects include hypotension, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, injection site reaction, nausea/vomiting, altered mental status, fever, metabolic acidosis, cerebral edema, seizures, anemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. CNS side effects are more frequent with ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) and CPS. Blood and lymphatic system disorders and hypotension are common in patients 30 days old or younger, whereas nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are common in patients more than 30 days old.
Although no formal drug interaction studies have been completed, penicillin antibiotics and probenecid may increase serum concentrations of sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate by competing for renal tubular secretion. Use of valproic acid or corticosteroids may increase plasma ammonia levels.
Must be diluted and administered IV via central line; peripheral line administration may result in burning.

Contraindicated in Addison disease, hyperkalemia, use with eplerenone, or severe renal failure (see Chapter 31). Use with caution in dehydration, hyponatremia, and renal or hepatic dysfunction. Precipitation of impaired neurologic function, worsening hepatic encephalopathy, and coma may occur with hepatic disease with cirrhosis and ascites. May cause hyperkalemia (especially with severe heart failure), GI distress, rash, lethargy, dizziness, and gynecomastia. May potentiate ganglionic blocking agents and other antihypertensives. Monitor potassium levels and be aware of other K+ sources, K+-sparing diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs] (all of which can increase K+).
Do not use with other medications known to cause hyperkalemia (e.g., ACEIs, angiotensin II antago- nists, aldosterone blockers, and other potassium-sparing diuretics). Hyperkalemic metabolic acidosis has been reported with concurrent cholestyramine use. May cause false elevation in serum digoxin levels measured by radioimmunoassay.
Although TID-QID regimens have been recommended, data suggest once- or twice-daily dosing to be adequate. Pregnancy category changes to D if used in pregnancy-induced hypertension.

Paralysis for intubation (see remarks, cont.):
Adult:
Initial:
IV: 0.3-1.1 mg/kg/dose ×1
IM: 3-4 mg/kg/dose ×1; max. dose: 150 mg/dose
Maintenance for long surgical procedures: 0.04-0.07 mg/kg/dose IV Q 5-10 min PRN. Continuous infusion not recommended.
Contraindicated after the acute phase of an injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury because severe hyperkalemia and subsequent cardiac arrest may occur. Individuals carrying the RYR1 or CACNA1S gene have an increased risk for developing malignant hyperthermia with succinylcholine or halogenated volatile anesthetics; use in these individuals is contraindicated. Succinylcholine should be avoided in patients who are susceptible to malignant hyperthermia.
Pretreatment with atropine is recommended to reduce incidence of bradycardia. For rapid sequence intubation, see Chapter 1.
Cardiac arrest has been reported in children and adolescents primarily with skeletal muscle myopathies (e.g., Duchenne muscular dystrophy). Identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy prior to use. Predose creatine kinase may be useful for identifying patients at risk. Monitoring of the electro- cardiogram (ECG) for peaked T waves may be useful in detecting early signs of this adverse effect.
May cause malignant hyperthermia (use dantrolene to treat), bradycardia, hypotension, arrhythmia, and hyperkalemia. Severe anaphylactic reactions have been reported; use caution if previous anaphylactic reaction to other neuromuscular blocking agents. Use with caution in patients
with severe burns, paraplegia, or crush injuries and in patients with preexisting hyperkalemia. Beware of prolonged depression in patients with liver disease, malnutrition, pseudocholinesterase deficiency, hypothermia and those receiving aminoglycosides, phenothiazines, quinidine, ß block- ers, amphotericin B, cyclophosphamide, diuretics, lithium, acetylcholine, and anticholinesterases. Diazepam may decrease neuromuscular blocking effects. Prior use of succinylcholine may enhance the neuromuscular blocking effect of vecuronium and its duration of action.
Duration of action 4-6 min IV, 10-30 min IM. Must be prepared to intubate within 1 min.

SUCRALFATE continued

May cause vertigo, constipation, and dry mouth. Hypersensitivity, including anaphylactic reactions, and hyperglycemia in diabetic patients have been reported. Aluminum may accumulate in patients with renal failure. This may be augmented by the use of aluminum-containing antacids. Use with caution in patients with dysphagia or other conditions that may alter gag or cough reflexes or diminish oropharyngeal coordination/ motility who are receiving the oral tablet dosage form; cases of tablet aspiration with respiratory complications have been reported.
Decreases absorption of phenytoin, digoxin, theophylline, cimetidine, fat-soluble vitamins, ketocon- azole, omeprazole, quinolones, and oral anticoagulants. Administer these drugs at least 2 hr before or after sucralfate doses.
Drug requires an acidic environment to form a protective polymer coating for damaged GI tract mucosa. Administer oral doses on an empty stomach (1 hr before meals and QHS).





Injection: 100 mg/1 mL (2, 5 mL)
Infant, child, and adolescent (limited data):
Routine reversal of rocuronium-induced moderate blockade (see remarks):
2 mg/kg/dose IV once over 10 sec; some suggest administering over slow intravenous push to reduce risk for bradycardia or asystole.
Adult (use actual body weight):
Reversal rocuronium or vecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade:
Deep block (spontaneous recovery of twitch response reaching 1 to 2 post-tetanic counts with no twitch responses to train-of-four stimulation): 4 mg/kg/dose IV ×1
Moderate block (spontaneous recovery of reappearance of the second twitch in response of train-of-four stimulation): 2 mg/kg/dose IV ×1
Reversal of neuromuscular blockade 3 min after rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg: 16 mg/kg/dose IV ×1. The recovery to T1 of 10% baseline (relative to the time of administration of rocuronium or succinylcho- line) was faster with rocuronium/sugammadex than with succinylcholine alone. This dose has not been evaluated for vecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade.
Sugammadex is a modified gamma cyclodextrin that binds to rocuronium and vecuronium for reduced neuromuscular blockade.
Use is not recommended for GFR <30 mL/min or on dialysis. Use with caution in hepatic impairment, especially in the presence of coagulopathy or severe edema.
Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, and headache. Serious effects include bradycardia, prolonged QTc interval, hypersensitivity reactions/anaphylaxis, increase creatine kinase, and bronchospasms. Sugammadex may increase the effects/toxicity of anticoagulants, and decrease the effects of hormonal contraceptives. Fusidic acid and toremifene may decrease sugammadex activity.
Limited data in children (especially <2 yr) and dosing in a multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, dose-finding study in 63 children (28 days to 17 yr of age) and 28 adult surgical patients.
Doses were well tolerated across all ages with dose-response relationship for those 2 yr of age or older. All had a median recovery time of 1.1 to 1.2 min after a 2 mg/kg dose (Anesthesiology. 2009;110:284-294).



Ophthalmic solution (Bleph 10 and generics): 10% (5, 15 mL); may contain thimerosal or benzalkonium chloride
Ophthalmic ointment: 10% (3.5 g)

May cause kernicterus in newborns; may cause blood dyscrasias, crystalluria, glossitis, renal or hepatic injury, GI irritation, rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency. Severe hyponatremia may occur during treatment of Pneumocystic jiroveci pneumonia. Hyperkalemia may appear in HIV/AIDS patients. Use with caution in renal and hepatic impairment and in G6PD deficiency. QT prolongation resulting in ventricular tachycardia has been reported. Slow acetylators may be prone to idiosyncratic reactions to sulfonamides. Intravenous dosage form contains propylene glycol and benzyl alcohol, which may result in adverse toxic effects when used at igher dosages, especially in neonates. Use of an adjusted body weight ([ABW] ABW = ideal body weight + 0.4 × [total body weight - ideal body weight]) has been recommended for determining doses for obese patients.
Epidemiologic studies suggest that use during pregnancy may be associated with increase risk of congenital malformations (particularly neural tube defects), cardiovascular malformations, urinary tract defects, oral clefts, and club foot.
Sulfamethoxazole is a CYP 450 2C9 substrate and inhibitor. Trimethoprim is a CYP 450 2C9, 3A4 substrate and 2C8/9 inhibitor. Reduce dose in renal impairment (see Chapter 31).

PO and SC efficacy studies were not conclusive in clinical trials for children. Some do not recommend use in patients less than 18 yr of age owing to poor efficacy and reports of serious adverse events (e.g., stroke, visual loss, and death) in both children and adults with all dosage forms.
To minimize infant exposure to sumatriptan, avoid breastfeeding for 12 hr after treatment. See naproxen remarks if using the combination sumatriptan and naproxen dosage form.



Suspension for inhalation: 25 mg/mL phospholipids (4, 8 mL); contains 0.5-1.75 mg triglycerides,
1.4-3.5 mg free fatty acids and <1 mg protein per 1 mL drug
Prophylactic therapy: 4 mL/kg/dose intratracheally as soon as possible; up to four doses may be given at intervals no shorter than Q 6 hr during the first 48 hr of life.
Rescue therapy (treatment): 4 mL/kg/dose intratracheally immediately following the diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). May repeat dose as needed Q 6 hr to max. of four doses total.
Method of administration for previously listed therapies (see remarks): Suction infant prior to administration. Each dose is divided into four aliquots of 1 mL/kg each; administer
1 mL/kg in each of four different positions (slight downward inclination with head turned to the right, head turned to the left; slight upward inclination with the head turned to the right,
head turned to the left).
Transient bradycardia, O2 desaturation, pallor, vasoconstriction, hypotension, endotracheal tube blockage, hypercarbia, hypercapnea, apnea, and hypertension may occur during the administration process. Other side effects may include pulmonary interstitial emphysema, pulmonary air leak, and posttreatment nosocomial sepsis. Monitor heart rate and transcutaneous O2 saturation during dose administration and arterial blood gases for postdose hyperoxia and hypocarbia after administration.
All doses are administered intratracheally via a 5-french feeding catheter. If the suspension settles during storage, gently swirl the contents; do not shake. Drug is stored in the refrigerator, protected from light, and must be warmed by standing at room temperature for at least 20 min or warmed in the hand for at least 8 min. Artificial warming methods should NOT be used.


Intratracheal suspension: 35 mg/mL phospholipids (3, 6 mL); contains 26 mg phosphatidylcholine,
0.7 mg protein, and 0.26 mg surfactant protein B per 1 mL
Prophylactic therapy: 3 mL/kg/dose intratracheally as soon as possible; up to a total of three doses may be given Q 12 hr.
Rescue therapy (treatment; see remarks): 3 mL/kg/dose intratracheally immediately after the diagno- sis of RDS. May repeat dose as needed Q12 hr to max. of 3 doses total.
Method of administration for previously listed therapies (see remarks): Suction infant prior to administration. Manufacturer recommends administration through a side-port adapter into the endotracheal tube with two attendants (one to instill drug and another to monitor and position patient). Each dose is divided into two aliquots of 1.5-mL/kg each; administer 1.5 mL/kg in each of two different positions (infant positioned with either the right or left side dependent). Drug is
administered while ventilation is continued over 20 to 30 breaths for each aliquot, with small bursts timed only during the inspiratory cycles. A pause followed by evaluation of respiratory status and repositioning should separate the two aliquots. The drug has also been administered by divided dose into four equal aliquots and administered with repositioning in the prone, supine, right, and left lateral positions.

SURFACTANT, PULMONARY/CALFACTANT continued

Common adverse effects include cyanosis, airway obstruction, bradycardia, reflux of surfactant into the endotracheal (ET) tube, requirement for manual ventilation, and reintubation. Monitor O2 saturation and lung compliance after each dose such that oxygen therapy and ventilator pressure are adjusted as necessary.
All doses administered intratracheally via a 5-french feeding catheter. If suspension settles during storage, gently swirl the contents; do not shake. Drug is stored in the refrigerator, protected from light, and does not need to be warmed before administration. Unopened vials that have been warmed to room temperature (once only) may be refrigerated within 24 hr and stored for future use.
For rescue therapy, repeat doses may be administered as early as 6 hr after the previous dose for a total of up to four doses if the infant is still intubated and requires at least 30% inspired oxygen to maintain a PaO2 =80 torr.

Intratracheal suspension: 80 mg/mL (1.5, 3 mL): contains 76 mg phospholipids, 1 mg protein (0.45 mg surfactant protein B, and 0.59 mg surfactant protein C) per 1 mL drug
Rescue therapy (treatment): 2.5 mL/kg/dose × 1 intratracheally, immediately following the diagnosis of RDS. May administer 1.25 mL/kg/dose Q 12 hr × 2 doses as needed up to a max. total dose of 5 mL/kg.
Method of administration (see remarks): Suction infant prior to administration. Each dose is divided into two aliquots, with each aliquot administered into one of the two main bronchi by positioning the infant with either the right or left side dependent. After the first aliquot is administered, remove the catheter from the ET tube and manually ventilate the infant with 100% oxygen at a rate of 40-60 breaths/min for 1 min. When the infant is stable, reposition the infant and administer the second dose with the same procedures. Then remove the catheter without flushing.
Currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment (rescue therapy) of RDS. Transient episodes of bradycardia, decreased oxygen saturation, reflux of surfactant into the ET tube, and airway obstruction have occurred during dose administration. Monitor O2 saturation and lung compliance after each dose and adjust oxygen therapy and ventilator pressure as necessary. Pulmonary hemorrhage has been reported.
All doses administered intratracheally via a 5-french feeding catheter. Suction infant prior to admin- istration and 1 hr after surfactant instillation (unless signs of significant airway obstruction).

TACROLIMUS continued
Tacrolimus is a substrate of the CYP 450 3A4 drug metabolizing enzyme and Pgp transporter. A 1.5- 2-fold higher initial standard dose up to a max. dose of 0.3 mg/kg/24 hr has been recommended for intermediate or extensive metabolizers for CYP 450 3A5. Calcium channel blockers, imidazole antifungals (ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, clotrimazole, posaconazole), macrolide antibi- otics (erythromycin, clarithromycin, troleandomycin), cisapride, cimetidine, cyclosporine, danazol, herbal products containing schisandra sphenanthera extracts, methylprednisolone, grapefruit juice, seville oranges, and severe diarrhea can increase tacrolimus serum levels. In contrast, carbamazepine, caspofungin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, rifabutin, and sirolimus may decrease levels. Use with sirolimus may increase risk for hepatic artery thrombosis. Avoid use of live attenuated vaccines. Use with other CYP 450 3A inhibitors and substrates has the potential to prolong the cardiac QT interval. Reduce dose in renal or hepatic insufficiency.
Monitor trough levels (just prior to a dose at steady state). Steady state is generally achieved after 2-5 days of continuous dosing. Interpretation will vary based on treatment protocol and assay methodology (whole blood ELISA vs. MEIA vs. HPLC). Whole blood trough concentrations of 5-20 ng/mL have been recommended in liver transplantation at 1-12 mo. Trough levels of 7-20 ng/ mL (whole blood) for the first 3 mo and 5-15 ng/mL after 3 mo have been recommended in renal transplantation. African Americans may need to be titrated to higher dosages.
Tacrolimus therapy generally should be initiated 6 hr or more after transplantation. PO is the preferred route of administration and all PO dosage forms should be administered on an empty stomach (1 hr before and 2 hr after meals).
Astagraf XL (extended release capsule): Safety and efficacy has been established for de novo and stable (receiving immediate-release dosage form) pediatric kidney transplant patients. A mg per mg conversion from immediate release dosage form to Astagraf XL has been recommended.
Envarsus XR (extended release tablet): Currently labeled for use in adult kidney transplant patients (de novo and stable on immediate-release tacrolimus). When converting to Envarsus XR from immediate-release dosage form, initiate at 80% of the established immediate-release dosage form.
All extended-release formulations are NOT interchangeable. IV infusions should be administered at concentrations between 0.004 and 0.02 mg/mL diluted with NS or D5W.
TOPICAL USE: Not recommended for use in patients with skin conditions with a skin barrier defect with the potential for systemic absorption. Do not use in children <2 yr, immunocompromised patients, or with occlusive dressings (promotes systemic absorption). Approved as a second-line therapy for short-term and intermittent treatment of atopic dermatitis for patients who fail to respond, or do not tolerate, other approved therapies. Long-term safety is unknown. Skin burn sen- sation, pruritus, flu-like symptoms, allergic reaction, skin erythema, headache, and skin infection are the most common side effects. Application site edema has been reported. Although the risk is uncertain, the FDA has issued an alert about the potential cancer risk with the use of this product. See www.fda.gov/medwatch for the latest information.

Tinea cruris/Tinea corporis: Apply topically (cream or spray) to affected area once daily × 1 wk
Pityriasis (tinea) versicolor: Apply spray to affected area once daily × 1 wk
SYSTEMIC USE: Contraindicated in chronic or acute liver disease. Common side effects include headache, fever, cough, diarrhea, taste disorder, increased LFTs, GI disturbances, and rash. Severe dermatological reactions (e.g., SJS, TEN), hearing loss, neutropenia, thrombotic microangiopathy, and liver failure (some fatal) have been reported. Monitor AST/ALT at baseline and repeat with CBC if therapy is >6 wk. Signs and symptoms of liver disease may include persistent nausea, anorexia, fatigue, vomiting, right upper abdominal pain, or jaundice. Discontinue use immediately if biochemical or clinical evidence of liver injury develops.
Use with caution in renal impairment as terbinafine's clearance has been shown to decrease by
~50% in adults with CrCl =50 mL/min. Terbinafine inhibits CYP 450 2D6, thus increasing the effects/toxicity of 2D6 substrates such as amphetamines, risperidone, and fluoxetine.
Doses may be administered with or without food.
TOPICAL USE: Do not use on/in the eyes, mouth, nails, scalp, or vaginal areas. Local irritation, skin rash, xeroderma, pruritus, and contact dermatitis may occur.

Acne: 500 mg PO BID
Adult: 250-500 mg PO Q6-12 hr
Not recommended in patients <8 yr owing to tooth staining and decreased bone growth. Also not recommended for use in pregnancy because these side effects may occur in the fetus. The risk for these adverse effects is highest with long-term use. May cause nausea, GI upset, hepatotoxicity, stomatitis, rash, fever, and superinfection. Photosensitivity reaction may occur. Avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight.
Never use outdated tetracyclines because they may cause Fanconi-like syndrome. Do not give with dairy products or with any divalent cations (i.e., Fe2+, Ca2+, Mg2+). Give 1 hr before or 2 hr after meals.
May decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives, increase serum digoxin levels, and increase effects of warfarin. Use with methoxyflurane increases risk for nephrotoxicity and use with isotreti- noin is associated with pseudotumor cerebri. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).
Short-term maternal use is not likely to cause harm to breast-feeding infants.

Works on CFTR trafficking defect by acting as a CFTR corrector (tezacaftor) and in combination with a CFTR potentiator (ivacaftor). Indicated for individuals with homozygous F508del CFTR mutation or who have at least one CFTR mutation that is responsive to this drug based on in vitro data and/or clinical evidence.
Continued


TEZACAFTOR AND IVACAFTOR continued
Common side effects include headache, nausea, sinus congestion, and dizziness. Increased liver enzymes and cataracts may occur; monitor baseline AST/ALT and ocular exam at baseline. Repeat AST/ALT every 3 months for the first year followed by annual assessments. Repeat ocular exams annually. May cause a false positive urine drug screen for cannabinoids.
Use with caution with CrCl =30 mL/min and ESRD. Reduce dose with moderate/severe hepatic
  impairment or when initiating therapy while taking a CYP 450 3A4 inhibitor (see dosing section). Tezacaftor and ivacaftor are substrates for CYP 450 3A4/3A5. Use with strong CYP 450 3A induc-
ers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, St. John's wort) is not recommended. Tezacaftor and ivacaftor may increase the effects/toxicity of cyclosporine, digoxin, everolimus, sirolimus, tacrolimus, and warfarin. Always evaluate potential drug-drug interactions; see https://www.symdekohcp.com/drug-interactions. Avoid food or drink containing grapefruit or Seville oranges.
Administer all doses with high-fat foods to assure absorption. If a dose (all dosage forms) is missed within 6 hrs of a scheduled dose, administer a dose immediately. However, if the missed dose is
>6 hr, skip that dose and resume therapy at the next scheduled dose. Never take a double dose for a missed dose.

Maintenance, child >1 yr and adult without risk factors for altered clearance (see remarks):
<45 kg: Begin therapy at 12-14 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q4-6 hr up to max. dose of 300 mg/24 hr. If needed based on serum levels, gradually increase to 16-20 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q4-6 hr. Max. dose: 600 mg/24 hr.
=45 kg: Begin therapy with 300 mg/24 hr ÷ Q6-8 hr. If needed based on serum levels, gradually
increase to 400-600 mg/24 hr ÷ Q6-8 hr.
Drug metabolism varies widely with age, drug formulation, and route of administration. Most common side effects and toxicities are nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, gastroesophageal reflux, nervousness, tachycardia, seizures, and arrhythmias.
Serum levels should be monitored. Therapeutic levels: bronchospasm: 10-20 mg/L; apnea: 7-13 mg/L. Half-life is age-dependent: 30 hr (newborns); 6.9 hr (infants); 3.4 hr (children); 8.1 hr (adults). See Aminophylline for guidelines for serum level determinations. Liver impairment, cardiac failure, and sustained high fever may increase theophylline levels. Theophylline is a substrate for CYP 450 1A2. Levels are increased with allopurinol, alcohol, ciprofloxacin, cimetidine, clarithromycin, disulfiram, erythromycin, estrogen, isoniazid, propranolol, thiabendazole, and verapamil. Levels are decreased with carbamazepine, isoproterenol, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and rifampin. May cause increased skeletal muscle activity, agitation, and hyperactivity when used with doxapram, and increase quinine levels/toxicity.
Use ideal body weight in obese patients when calculating dosage because of poor distribution into body fat. Risk factors for increased clearance include: smoking, cystic fibrosis, hyperthyroidism, and high-protein diet. Factors for decreased clearance include CHF, correction of hyperthyroidism, fever, viral illness, sepsis, and high carbohydrate diet.

Schizophrenia:
Child =6 yr-adolescent: Start with 0.5 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ BID-TID (initial max.: 50 mg/dose); dosage range: 0.5-3 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ BID-TID. Max. dose: 3 mg/kg/24 hr.
Adult: Start with 75-300 mg/24 hr PO ÷ TID. Then gradually increase PRN to max. dose
800 mg/24 hr ÷ BID-QID.
Indicated for schizophrenia unresponsive to standard therapy. Contraindicated in severe CNS depression, brain damage, narrow-angle glaucoma, blood dyscrasias, and severe liver or cardiovascular disease. DO NOT co-administer with drugs which may inhibit the CYP 450 2D6 isoenzymes (e.g., SSRIs such as fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine; and beta-blockers such as propranolol and pindolol); drugs which may widen the QTc interval (e.g., disopyramide, procainamide, quinidine); and in patients with known reduced activity of CYP 450 2D6.
May cause drowsiness, extrapyramidal reactions, autonomic symptoms, ECG changes (QTc prolongation in a dose-dependent manner), arrhythmias, paradoxical reactions, and endocrine disturbances. Long-term use may cause tardive dyskinesia. Pigmentary retinopathy may occur with higher doses; a periodic eye exam is recommended. More autonomic symptoms and less extra- pyramidal effects than chlorpromazine. Concurrent use with epinephrine can cause hypotension. Increased cardiac arrhythmias may occur with tricyclic antidepressants.
In an overdose situation, monitor ECG and avoid drugs that can widen QTc interval.

mean 9.3 + 4.1): Initial dose of 0.25 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ TID × 4 wk. Dosage was increased
at 4-wk intervals to 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mg/kg/24 hr until an effective and well-tolerated dose was established. Criteria for dose increase required tolerance of the current dosage level and <50% reduction in seizures. Patients receiving enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) received a max. daily dose of 0.73 + 0.44 mg/kg/24 hr and patients receiving non-enzyme inducing AEDs received a max. of 0.61 + 0.32 mg/kg/24 hr.

TIAGABINE continued
Adjunctive therapy for partial seizures (dosage based on use with enzyme-inducing AEDs; see remarks). NOTE: Patients receiving non-enzyme-inducing AEDs had tiagabine blood levels about two times higher than patients receiving enzyme-inducing AEDs.
=12 yr and adult: Start at 4 mg PO once daily × 7 days. If needed, increase dose to 8 mg/24 hr PO
÷ BID. Dosage may be increased further by 4-8 mg/24 hr at weekly intervals (daily doses may be divided BID-QID) until a clinical response is achieved or up to specified max. dose.
Max. dose:
12-18 yr: 32 mg/24 hr
Adult: 56 mg/24 hr
Use with caution in hepatic insufficiency (may need to reduce dose and/or increase dosing interval). Most common side effects include dizziness, somnolence, depression, confusion, and asthenia. Nervousness, tremor, nausea, abdominal pain, confusion, and difficulty in concentrating may also occur. Cognitive/neuropsychiatric symptoms resulting in nonconvulsive status epilepticus requiring subsequent dose reduction or drug discontinuation have been reported. Suicidal behavior or ideation, bullous dermatitis, and blurred vision have been reported. Off-label use in patients WITHOUT epilepsy is discouraged due to reports of seizures in these patients.
Tiagabine's clearance is increased by concurrent hepatic enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and barbiturates), and St. John's Wort. Lower doses or a slower titration for clinical response may be necessary for patients receiving non-enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., valproate, gabapentin, and lamotrigine). Avoid abrupt discontinuation of drug.
TID dosing schedule may be preferred since BID schedule may not be well tolerated. Doses should be administered with food.

Asthma (maintenance therapy, see remarks):
Child =6 yr, adolescent, and adult:
Spiriva Respimat: Inhale two 1.25 mCg actuations once daily.
Contraindicated in patients with ipratropium hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., angioedema, itching, or rash). Common side effects include headache, constipation, xerostomia, UTI, bronchitis, cough, pharyngitis, sinusitis, and URI. Bowel obstruction, angle-closure glaucoma, urinary retention, and bronchospasm have been reported. The pediatric adverse reaction profile is similar to adults.
Use as an add-on maintenance therapy for asthma along with inhaled corticosteroid. Maximum benefits may take up to 4-8 wk of continuous use. Doses >2.5 mCg/24 hr were not associated with greater efficacy in FEV1 for asthmatic adults.


TIOTROPIUM continued
Monitor for anticholinergic side effects in patients with moderate/severe renal impairment (eGFR <60 mL/min).
Administration of Spiriva Respimat 1.25 mCg × 2 delivered with the AeroChamber Plus Flow-Vu hold- ing chamber with/without facemask by an in vitro study utilizing inspiratory flow rates for children 6-12 mo, 2-5 yr, and >5 yr has been shown to deliver a comparable adult dose on a mCg per body weight basis. Despite a report of similar adverse reaction profile to adolescents and adults from a 12-wk placebo control trial (2.5 mCg/24 hr) in children 1-5 yr, the clinical efficacy and safety have not been fully established for children <6 years of age with asthma.

TOBI Podhaler: Inhale four 28-mg capsules (112 mg) Q12 hr administered in repeated cycles of 28 days on drug followed by 28 days off drug.
Use with caution in combination with neurotoxic, ototoxic, or nephrotoxic drugs; anesthetics or neuromuscular blocking agents; pre-existing renal, vestibular, or auditory impairment; and in patients with neuromuscular disorders. May cause ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and neuromuscular blockade. Serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and dermatologic reactions including exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported rarely. Ototoxic effects synergistic with furosemide.
Higher doses are recommended in patients with cystic fibrosis, neutropenia, or burns. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31). Monitor peak and trough levels.
Therapeutic peak levels with conventional Q8 hr dosing:
6-10 mg/L in general
8-10 mg/L in pulmonary infections, neutropenia, osteomyelitis, and severe sepsis
Therapeutic trough levels with conventional Q8 hr dosing: <2 mg/L. Recommended serum sampling time at steady state: trough within 30 min prior to the third consecutive dose and peak 30-60 min after the administration of the third consecutive dose.
Therapeutic peak and trough goals for high-dose extended-interval dosing for cystic fibrosis:
Peak: 20-40 mg/L; recommended serum sampling time at 30-60 min after the administration of the first dose.
  Trough: <1 mg/L; recommended serum sampling time within 30 min before the second dose.
Serum levels should be rechecked with changing renal function, poor clinical response, and at a minimum of once weekly for prolonged therapies.
To maximize bactericidal effects, an individualized peak concentration to target a peak/MIC ratio of 8-10:1 may be applied.
For initial dosing in obese patients, use an adjusted body weight (ABW). ABW = Ideal Body Weight +
0.4 (Total Body Weight - Ideal Body Weight).


TOBRAMYCIN continued
INHALATIONAL USE: Transient voice alteration, bronchospasm, dyspnea, pharyngitis, and increased cough may occur. Transient tinnitus, decreased appetite, and hearing loss have been reported with nebulized dosage forms. Aphonia, discolored sputum, and malaise have been reported
with the powder for inhalation. Use is not recommended with nephrotoxic, neurotoxic, or ototoxic medications, or when intravenous antibiotic therapy is prescribed. When used with other inhaled medications in cystic fibrosis, use the following order of administration: bronchodilator first, chest physiotherapy, other inhaled medications (if indicated), and tobramycin last. For TOBI Podhaler, inhale the entire contents of each capsule. To improve adherence with prophylactic inhalation therapy, initiate each 28-day inhalation cycle on the first day of an odd or even numbered month.

Use with caution in renal and hepatic dysfunction (decreased clearance) and sulfa hypersensitivity. Reduce dose by 50% when creatinine clearance is <70 mL/min. Common side effects (incidence lower in children) include ataxia, cognitive dysfunction, dizziness, nystagmus, paresthesia, sedation, visual disturbances, nausea, dyspepsia, and kidney stones (incidence higher in children). Secondary angle closure glaucoma characterized by ocular pain, acute myopia, and increased intraocular pressure has been reported and may lead to blindness if left untreated. Patients should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they experience blurred vision or periorbital pain.
Oligohidrosis and hyperthermia has been reported primarily in children and should be monitored especially during hot weather and with use of drugs that predispose patients to heat-related disorders (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and anticholinergics). Low serum bicarbonate levels have been reported in pediatric and adult clinical trials.
Hyperchloremic, non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, hyperammonemia (with or without encephalopathy), suicidal behavior or ideation, and false-positive sweat chloride test for cystic fibrosis have been reported.

TOPIRAMATE continued
Drug is metabolized by and inhibits the CYP 450 2C19 isoenzyme. Phenytoin, valproic acid, and carbamazepine may decrease topiramate levels. Topiramate may decrease valproic acid, digoxin, warfarin, and ethinyl estradiol (to decrease oral contraceptive efficacy) but may increase phenytoin levels/effects. Alcohol and CNS depressants may increase CNS side effects. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., acetazolamide) may increase risk of metabolic acidosis, nephrolithiasis, or pares- thesia. Use with valproic acid may result in the development of hyperammonemia.
Safety and efficacy in migraine prophylaxis in pediatrics have not been established; an increase in serum creatinine has been reported in a clinical trial.
Qudexy XR and Trokendi XR are not bioequivalent and should not be interchanged. Doses may be administered with or without food. Capsule may be opened and sprinkled on small amount of food (e.g., 1 teaspoonful of applesauce) and swallowed whole (do not chew). Maintain adequate hydra- tion to prevent kidney stone formation. If discontinuing therapy, gradually taper dosage.

Tabs: 50, 100, 150, 300 mg
Oral suspension: 10 mg/mL
Insomnia with comorbid psychiatric disorders (limited data):
18 mo to <3 yr: Start at 25 mg PO QHS. If needed, increase by 25 mg Q2 week up to a max. of 100 mg/24 hr.
3-5 yr: Start at 50 mg PO QHS, if needed, increase by 25 mg Q2 week up to a max. of 150 mg/24 hr.
5 yr-adolescent: 25-50 mg PO QHS, if needed, increase by 25-50 mg Q2 week up to a max. of 200 mg/24 hr. Daily dose may be divided BID-TID when used for palliative care.
Use with caution in pre-existing cardiac disease, initial recovery phase of MI, in patients receiving antihypertensive medications, renal and hepatic impairment (has not been evaluated), and electroconvulsive therapy. Common side effects include dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, and diarrhea. May cause angle-closure glaucoma in patients with anatomically narrow angles who do not have an iridectomy. Seizures, tardive dyskinesia, EPS, arrhythmias, priapism, blurred vision, neuromuscular weakness, anemia, orthostatic hypotension, and rash have been reported. Monitor for clinical worsening of depression and suicidal ideation/behavior following the initiation of therapy or after dose changes.
Trazodone is CYP 450 3A4 isoenzyme substrate (may interact with inhibitors and inducers) and may increase digoxin levels and increase CNS effects of alcohol, barbiturates, and other CNS depres- sants. Max. antidepressant effect is seen at 2-6 wk.

TREPROSTINIL continued
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH):
IV/SC infusion:
Child (limited data): Initial dose of 2 nanogram/kg/min has been recommended with careful titration. Stable doses have been reported at 50-80 nanogram/kg/min with an unknown maximum dosage. Dosages as high as 350 and 170 nanogram/kg/min have been reported with the SC and IV routes, respectively.
Adult: Start at 1.25 nanogram/kg/min. If not tolerated, reduce to 0.625 nanogram/kg/min. If needed, increase dose at increments of 1.25 nanogram/kg/min per week for the first 4 wk followed by 2.5 nanogram/kg/min per week thereafter. Limited experience with doses >40 nanogram/kg/min.
Inhalation:
Child (limited data): 1-9 (6-54 mCg) patient-activated breaths Q6 hr. A retrospective report of 29 chil- dren with PAH receiving background therapy initially received 3 breaths (18 mCg) via oral inhalation QID and titrated doses weekly as tolerated to a maximum of 9 breaths (54 mCg) QID for =6 wk. 19 of 29 children had WHO functional class improvement (significant improvements in exercise tolerance and peak oxygen consumption). Four children had to discontinue therapy for reasons of O2 desatura- tion (1), progression of PAH (1), and chest tightness with bronchospasms (2).
Adult: Start at 3 breaths (18 mCg) via oral inhalation Q4 hr four times a day during waking hours. Reduce dose to 1 or 2 breaths if not tolerated and subsequently increase to 3 breaths. If tolerated, increase dose by 3 additional inhalations at ~1-2 wk intervals to the target and maximum mainte- nance dose of 9 breaths (54 mCg) QID.
Use with caution in liver or renal impairment by titrating doses slowly. Avoid use with the oral dosage form in Child-Pugh class B and C. Treprostinil is primarily metabolized by the liver via CYP 450 2C8 and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the urinary route.
Inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) and inducers (e.g., rifampin) may increase and decrease treprostinil effects, respectfully.
Flushing, muscle pain (especially with SC route), headaches, and diarrhea are common side effects with injectable routes. Central line gram-negative catheter infections have been reported with the IV route. Recommendations for reducing this risk include using watertight seals in the drug delivery system and closed-hub systems, replacing the diluent with the diluent used for epoprostenol, and using the SC route. Thrombocytopenia has been reported with SC administration. Worsening of reactive airway symptoms, cough, dizziness, bone pain, headache, syncope, and flushing may occur with the inhaled route. Headache, diarrhea, nausea, and flushing are common side effects with the oral dosage form in clinical trials.
Treprostinil has a longer T1/2 than epoprostenol with better room temperature stability (depending on specific diluent used).
Do not abruptly withdrawal therapy and have a backup plan for interruptions with IV/SC continuous therapies (e.g., backup pumps and medications).

NASAL USE: Rare reports of bone mineral density loss and osteoporosis have been reported with prolonged use of inhaled dosage form. Nasal preparations may cause epistaxis, cough, fever, nausea, throat irritation, dyspepsia, and fungal infections (rarely). Shake intranasal dosage forms before each use.
TOPICAL USE: Topical preparations may cause dermal atrophy, telangiectasias, and hypopigmenta- tion. HPA axis suppression, Cushing syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children with topical use. Topical steroids should be used with caution on the face and in intertriginous areas. See Chapter 8. Avoid spraying the eye or inhaling the topical aerosol dosage form. Aerosol dosage form is flammable.


TRIAMCINOLONE continued
INJECTABLE USE: Anaphylaxis has been reported with use of the injectable dosage form. Dosage adjustment for hepatic failure with systemic use may be necessary. Triamcinolone is a substrate of the CYP 450 3A4 enzyme; inhibitors of this enzyme may increase risk for side effects. Use with
caution in thyroid dysfunction, respiratory TB, ocular herpes simplex, peptic ulcer disease, osteopo- rosis, hypertension, CHF, myasthenia gravis, ulcerative colitis, and renal dysfunction. With systemic use, pregnancy category changes to "D" if used in the first trimester. Avoid IV administration with injectable dosage forms. Injectable forms contain benzyl alcohol.


Caps: 50, 100 mg
Hypertension:
Child: 1-2 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ BID. May increase up to a max. of 3-4 mg/kg/24 hr up to 300 mg/24 hr.
Adult: 50-100 mg/24 hr ÷ once daily-BID PO; max. dose: 300 mg/24 hr.
Do not use if GFR <10 mL/hr or in severe hepatic disease. Adjust dose in renal impairment (see Chapter 31) and cirrhosis. Monitor serum electrolytes. May cause hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, and metabolic acidosis. Interstitial nephritis, thrombocytopenia, and anaphylaxis have been reported.
Concurrent use of ACE inhibitors may increase serum potassium. Use with caution when administer- ing medications with high potassium load (e.g., some penicillins) and in patients with hepatic impairment or on high potassium diets. Cimetidine may increase effects. This drug is also avail- able as a combination product with hydrochlorothiazide; erythema multiforme and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported with this combination product. Administer doses with food to minimize GI upset. Pregnancy category changes to "D" if used in pregnancy-induced hypertension.


Ophthalmic solution: 1% (7.5 mL); contains thimerosal
Herpes keratoconjunctivitis:
=6 yr, adolescent and adult: Instill 1 drop into affected eye(s) Q2 hr while awake up to
a maximum of 9 drops/24 hr. Reduce dose when there is re-epithelialization of the corneal ulcer to 1 drop Q4 hr (minimum 5 drops/24 hr) × 7 days. If improvement does not occur in 7-14 days, consider alternative therapy. DO NOT EXCEED 21 days of treatment.
Burning sensation in eyes and palpebral edema are common side effects. Rare cross sensitivity with idoxuridine, increased intraocular pressure, keratoconjunctivitis, and ocular hyperemia have been reported.
Avoid touching the applicator tip to eye, fingers, or other surfaces, and do not wear contact lenses during treatment of ocular infections. Apply pressure to the lacrimal sac during and for 1-2 min after dose administration to reduce risk of systemic absorption.
Store medication in the refrigerator (2-8°C). Storage at room temperature will result in a decrease in pH to cause stinging and ocular discomfort when in use.

Genital herpes:
Adolescent and adult:
Initial episodes: 1 g/dose PO BID × 10 days. Recurrent episodes: 500 mg/dose PO BID × 3 days Suppressive therapy:
Immunocompetent patient: 500-1000 mg/dose PO once daily × 1 year, then reassess for recurrences. Patients with <9 recurrences per yr may be dosed at 500 mg/dose PO once daily × 1 yr.
Herpes labialis (cold sores; initiated at earliest symptoms):
=12 yr and adult:
Immunocompetent: 2 g/dose PO Q12 hr × 2 doses (1 day)
HIV positive: 1 g/dose PO Q12 hr × 5-10 days
This pro-drug is metabolized to acyclovir and L-valine with better oral absorption than acyclovir. Use with caution in hepatic or renal insufficiency (adjust dose; see Chapter 31). Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS) has been reported in patients with advanced HIV infection and in bone marrow and renal transplant recipients. Probenecid or cimetidine can reduce the rate of conversion to acyclovir.
  Headache, nausea, and abdominal pain are common adverse events in adults. Headache is common in children. See Acyclovir for additional drug interactions and adverse effects.
For initial episodes of genital herpes, therapy is most effective when initiated within 48 hr of symptom onset. Therapy should be initiated immediately after the onset of symptoms in recurrent episodes (no efficacy data when initiating therapy >24 hr after onset of symptoms). Data are not available for use as suppressive therapy for periods >1 yr.
Valacyclovir CANNOT be substituted for acyclovir on a one-to-one basis. Doses may be administered with or without food.

Neonate and infant:
Symptomatic congenital CMV (from pharmacokinetic [PK] data in 8 infants 4-90 days old (mean: 20 days) and 24 neonates 8-34 days old): 15-16 mg/kg/dose PO BID produced similar levels to IV ganciclovir 6 mg/kg/dose BID. A comparison of 6 weeks vs. 6 months of therapy in 96 neonates (>32 wk gestation and =1.8 kg) showed modest improvement in long-term hearing and
developmental outcomes at 1-2 yr of age with the longer duration of therapy of 6 months.
Child (1 mo-16 yr):
CMV prophylaxis in kidney (4 mo-16 yr), heart (1 mo-16 yr), or liver (4 mo-16 yr) transplantation (see remarks): Once daily PO dosage initiated within 10 days of transplantation is calculated with the following equation:
Daily mg dose (max. dose: 900 mg) = 7 X BSA X CrCl. BSA is determined by the Mosteller equation and CrCL is determined by a modified Schwartz equation (max. value: 150 mL/min/1.73m2).
Mosteller BSA (m2) equation: square root of [(height (cm) X weight (kg)) ÷ 3600]


VALGANCICLOVIR continued

Modified Schwartz (mL/min/1.73 m2) equation (max. value: 150 mL/min/1.73 m2): k X height (cm) ÷ serum creatinine (mg/dL); where k = 0.33 if patient is <1 yr old with low birth weight for gestational age; k = 0.45 if patient is <1 yr old with birth weight appropriate for gesta- tional age or if patient is 1 to <2 yr old; k = 0.55 for males 2 to <13 yr old and females aged 2 to <16 yr old or; k = 0.7 if males 13-16 yr old.
Duration of therapy:
Kidney transplantation (=4 mo to 16 yr): 200 days
Heart transplantation (=1 mo to 16 yr): 100 days
Liver transplantation (=4 mo to 16 yr): 100-200 days; limited data.
Adolescent (>16 yr) and adult:
CMV retinitis:
Induction therapy: 900 mg PO BID × 14-21 days with food
Maintenance therapy: 900 mg PO once daily with food for a minimum of 3-6 mo.
CMV prophylaxis in heart, kidney, and kidney-pancreas transplantation: 900 mg PO once daily starting within 10 days of transplantation until 100 days post heart or kidney-pancreas transplan- tation; or until 200 days post kidney transplantation.
This pro-drug is metabolized to ganciclovir with better oral absorption than ganciclovir. Contraindicated with hypersensitivity to valganciclovir/ganciclovir; ANC <500 mm3; platelets <25,000 mm3; hemoglobin <8 g/dL; and patients on hemodialysis. Use with caution in renal insufficiency (adjust dose; see Chapter 31), preexisting bone marrow suppression, or receiving myelosuppressive drugs or irradiation. Has not been evaluated in hepatic impairment. May cause headache, insomnia, peripheral neuropathy, diarrhea, vomiting, neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Neutropenia incidence is greater at day 200 versus day 100 in pediatric kidney transplant patients.
Use effective contraception during and for at least 90 days after therapy; may impair fertility in men and women. See Ganciclovir for drug interactions and additional adverse effects.
Monitor CBC with differential, platelets, and serum creatinine at baseline and periodically during therapy. Consider changes in serum creatinine and body changes to height and body weight for prophylaxis dosing.
Valganciclovir CANNOT be substituted for ganciclovir on a one-to-one basis. All doses are adminis- tered with food. Avoid direct skin or mucous membrane contact with broken or crushed tablets.

Increment: 5-10 mg/kg/24 hr at weekly intervals to max. dose of 60 mg/kg/24 hr.
Maintenance: 30-60 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ BID-TID. Due to drug interactions, higher doses (up to 100 mg/ kg/24 hr ÷ TID-QID) may be required in children on other anticonvulsants. If using divalproex sodium, administer BID.

V
VALPROIC ACID continued
Intravenous route (use only when PO is not possible):
Use same PO daily dose ÷ Q6 hr. Convert back to PO as soon as possible.
Rectal route (use syrup, diluted 1:1 with water, given PR as a retention enema): Load: 20 mg/kg/dose
Maintenance: 10-15 mg/kg/dose Q8 hr
Migraine prophylaxis:
Child (limited data): Start at 10-15 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ BID (max. initial dose: 250 mg/dose). If needed, increase dose over 4-6 wk to 40-45 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ BID up to a maximum of 1000 mg/24 hr. Alternative dosing for child =12 yr is 250 mg PO BID (max. dose: 1000 mg/24 hr).
Adult: Start with 500 mg/24 hr ÷ PO BID. Dose may be gradually increased to a max. of 1000 mg/24 hr ÷ PO BID. If using divalproex sodium extended-release tablets, administer daily dose once daily.
Contraindicated in hepatic disease, pregnancy (for migraine indication), urea cycle disorders (e.g., OTC deficiency), mitochondrial disorders with mutations in DNA polymerase ? (e.g., Alpers- Huttenlocher syndrome), and children <2 yr suspected of the aforementioned mitochondrial disorder. May cause GI, liver, blood, and CNS toxicity; weight gain; transient alopecia; pancreatitis (potentially life-threatening); nausea; sedation; vomiting; headache; thrombocytopenia (dose-related); platelet dysfunction; rash (especially with lamotrigine); and hyperammonemia. Hepatic failure has occurred especially in children <2 yr (especially those receiving multiple anticonvulsants, with congenital metabolic disorders, with severe seizure disorders with mental retardation, and with organic brain disease). Idiosyncratic life-threatening pancreatitis has been reported in children and adults. Hyperammonemic encephalopathy has been reported in patients with urea cycle disorders. Suicidal behavior or ideation, male infertility, elevated testosterone, decreased bone mineral density, DRESS, encephalopathy without elevated ammonia levels, hair texture/color changes, and nail/nail bed disorders have been reported.
Valproic acid is a substrate for CYP 450 2C19 isoenzyme and an inhibitor of CYP 450 2C9, 2D6 and 3A3/4 (weak). It increases amitriptyline/nortriptyline, rufinamide, phenytoin, propofol, diazepam, and phenobarbital levels. Concomitant estrogen-containing contraceptives, phenytoin, phenobar- bital, topiramate, meropenem, cholestyramine, and carbamazepine may decrease valproic acid levels. Amitriptyline or nortriptyline may increase valproic acid levels. May interfere with urine ketone and thyroid tests.
Do not give syrup with carbonated beverages. Use of IV route has not been evaluated for >14 days of continuous use. Infuse IV over 1 hr up to a max. rate of 20 mg/min. Depakote and Depakote ER are NOT bioequivalent; see package insert for dose conversion.
Therapeutic levels: 50-100 mg/L. Recommendations for serum sampling at steady state: Obtain trough level within 30 min prior to the next scheduled dose after 2-3 days of continuous dosing. Levels of 50-60 mg/L and as high as 85 mg/L have been recommended for bipolar disorders. Monitor CBC and LFTs prior to and during therapy.
Valproic acid and divalproex should not be used in pregnant women. Increased risk of neural tube defects, decreased child IQ scores, craniofacial defects, and cardiovascular malformations have been reported in babies exposed to valproic acid and divalproex sodium.
Pregnancy category is "X" when used for migraine prophylaxis and is "D" for all other indications.

the following maximum doses:
<18 kg: 40 mg/24 hr
=18 kg: 80 mg/24 hr
Child 6-16 yr: Start at 1.3 mg/kg/dose (max. dose: 40 mg) PO once daily. Dose may be increased up to
  the 2.7 mg/kg/dose up to 160 mg (whichever is lower); doses greater than this have not been studied.
Adolescent =17 yr and adult (non-volume depleted status): Start 80 or 160 mg PO once daily; usual dose range is 80-320 mg once daily. Max. dose: 320 mg/24 hr.
Contraindicated with aliskiren use in diabetic patients. Discontinue use immediately after when pregnancy is detected. Use with caution in renal (CrCl <30 mL/min) and liver insufficiency, heart failure, post-myocardial infarction, renal artery stenosis, renal function changes, and volume depletion.
Hypotension, dizziness, headache, cough, and increases in BUN and sCr are common side effects. Hyperkalemia (most commonly reported in children <6 yr with underlying renal disease in clinical trials; also consider salt substitutes, foods, and medications which may increase potassium levels), bullous dermatitis, angioedema, acute renal failure, and dysgeusia have been reported. May increase lithium levels resulting in toxicity for those receiving concurrent lithium therapy; monitor lithium levels closely.
Onset of initial antihypertensive effects is 2 hr with maximum effects after 2-4 wk of chronic use. Patients may require higher doses of oral tablet dosage form than with the oral suspension due to increased bioavailability with the oral suspension.

Adult: 125 mg/dose PO Q6 hr × 7-10 days; dosages as high as 2 g/24 hr ÷ Q6-8 hr have also been used for severe/fulminant disease.
Endocarditis prophylaxis for GU or GI (excluding esophageal) procedures (complete all antibiotic dose infusion(s) within 30 min of starting procedure):
Moderate-risk patients allergic to ampicillin or amoxicillin:
Child: 20 mg/kg/dose (max. 1 g/dose) IV over 1-2 hr × 1
Adult: 1 g/dose IV over 1-2 hr × 1
High-risk patients allergic to ampicillin or amoxicillin:
Child and adult: Same dose as moderate-risk patients plus gentamicin 1.5 mg/kg/dose (max. dose: 120 mg/dose) IV/IM ×1
Ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity may occur and may be exacerbated with concurrent aminoglycoside use. Greater nephrotoxicity risk has been associated with higher therapeutic serum trough concentrations (?15 mg/mL), concurrent piperacillin/tazobactam therapy, and receiving furosemide in the intensive care unit. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31). Use total body weight for obese patients when calculating dosages. Low concentrations of the drug may appear in CSF with inflamed meninges. Nausea, vomiting, and drug-induced erythroderma are common with IV use. "Red man syndrome" associated with rapid IV infusion may occur. Infuse over 60 min (may infuse over 120 min if 60-min infusion is not tolerated). NOTE: Diphenhydramine is used to reverse red man syndrome. Allergic reactions (including drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms [DRESS]), neutropenia, and immune-mediated thrombocytopenia have been reported.
Although current extrapolated adult guidelines suggest measuring only trough levels, an additional post-distributional level may be useful in characterizing enhanced/altered drug clearance for quicker dosage modification to attain target levels; this may be useful for infants with known faster clearance and patients in renal compromise. Consult a pharmacist.
The following therapeutic trough level recommendations are based on the assumption that the pathogen's Vancomycin MIC is = 1 mg/L.
Indication	Goal trough level

Uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infection, uncomplicated bacteremia, febrile neutro- penia, sepsis
CNS infections, endocarditis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis

10-15 mg/L


15-19 mg/L

Peak level measurement (20-50 mg/L) has also been recommended for patients with burns, clinically nonresponsive in 72 hr of therapy, persistent positive cultures, and CNS infections (?30 mg/L).


VANCOMYCIN continued
Recommended serum sampling time at steady state: Trough within 30 min prior to the fourth consecutive dose and peak 60 min after the administration of the fourth consecutive
dose. Infants with faster elimination (shorter T1/2) may be sampled around the third consecutive dose.
Recent evidence strongly suggests moving away from serum trough vancomycin monitoring to a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) target of area under the curve (AUC) to MIC ratio. An AUC{24} of 400-600 mg*h/L is associated with clinical efficacy and reduced risk for AKI. Vancomycin therapeutic monitoring guidelines are currently being revised by the IDSA in collaboration with PIDS, SIDP, and ASHP and are forthcoming. Consult with an ID specialist and pharmacist to see how best this monitoring method is operationalized at your institution.
ORAL USE for C. difficile: Vancomycin (PO) or metronidazole (PO) are currently the recommended first-line therapy for children, whereas vancomycin (PO) or fidaxomicin is recommended for adults.
See Clinical Infectious Diseases 66(7):e1-e48 for the 2017 IDSA/SHEA Clinical Practice Guidelines. Common adverse effects with oral vancomycin capsules in adults include nausea, abdominal pain, and hypokalemia.

Maintenance: 0.05-0.1 mg/kg/dose IV Q1 hr PRN; may administer via continuous infusion at 0.09-0.15 mg/kg/hr IV.
Use with caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, and neuromuscular disease. Dose reduction may be necessary in hepatic insufficiency. Infants (7 wk to 1 yr) are more sensitive to the drug and may have a longer recovery time. Children (1-10 yr) may require higher doses and more frequent supplementation than adults. Enflurane, isoflurane, aminoglycosides, ß-blockers, calcium channel blockers, clindamycin, furosemide, magnesium salts, quinidine, procainamide, and cyclosporine may increase the potency and duration of neuromuscular blockade. Calcium, caffeine, carbamazepine, phenytoin, steroids (chronic use), acetylcholinesterases, and azathioprine may decrease effects. May
cause arrhythmias, rash, and bronchospasm. Severe anaphylactic reactions have been reported.
Neostigmine, pyridostigmine, or edrophonium are antidotes. Onset of action within 1-3 min. Duration is 30-40 min. See Chapter 1 for rapid sequence intubation.

No longer recommended as an antihypertensive agent for children. Contraindications include hypersensitivity, cardiogenic shock, severe CHF, sick sinus syndrome, or AV block. Use with caution in hepatic and renal (reduce dose in renal insufficiency; see Chapter 31) impairment. Owing to negative inotropic effects, verapamil should not be used to treat SVT in an emergency setting in infants. Avoid IV use in neonates and young infants due to apnea, bradycardia and hypotension. May cause constipation, headache, dizziness, edema, and hypotension. EPS has been reported.
Monitor ECG. Have calcium and isoproterenol available to reverse myocardial depression. May decrease neuromuscular transmission in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and worsen myasthenia gravis.

Drug is a substrate of CYP 450 1A2 and 3A3/4, and an inhibitor of CYP 3A4 and P-gp transporter. Barbiturates, sulfinpyrazone, phenytoin, vitamin D, and rifampin may decrease serum levels/ effects of verapamil; erythromycin, quinidine, and grapefruit juice may increase serum levels/ effects. Verapamil may increase effects/toxicity of ß-blockers (severe myocardial depression), car- bamazepine, cyclosporine, sirolimus, everolimus, digoxin, ethanol, fentanyl, lithium, nondepolariz- ing muscle relaxants, prazosin, and tizanidine. Use with telithromycin has resulted in hypotension, bradyarrhythmias, and lactic acidosis. Bradycardia has been reported with concurrent use of clonidine, and increased bleeding times has been reported with use with aspirin.
Do not crush or chew extended-release dosage forms.





Tabs (Sabril and generics): 500 mg
Powder for oral solution (Sabril, Vigadrone, and generics): 500 mg per packet to be dissolved in 10 mL water (50s)
Infantile spams (1 mo-2 yr; see remarks for discontinuation of therapy): Start at 50 mg/ kg/24 hr ÷ BID PO, if needed and tolerated, may titrate dosage upwards by 25-50 mg/kg/24 hr increments Q3 days up to a maximum of 150 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ BID. Withdrawal therapy if no clinical benefit is seen in 2-4 weeks.
Adjunctive therapy for refractory complex partial seizures (withdrawal therapy if no clinical benefit is seen in 3 months; see remarks for discontinuation of therapy):
Child =2 yr and =10 kg, and adolescent =16 yr: Start at 40 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ BID PO, if needed and
tolerated, adjust dose to the following maintenance dose:
10-15 kg: 500-1000 mg/24 hr ÷ BID
16-30 kg: 1000-1500 mg/24 hr ÷ BID
31-50 kg: 1500-3000 mg/24 hr ÷ BID
>50 kg: 2000-3000 mg/24 hr ÷ BID
Adolescent (=16 yr) and adult (see remarks for discontinuation of therapy): Start at 500 mg BID
PO, if needed and tolerated, increase daily dose by 500 mg increments at 7-day intervals. Usual recommended dose: 1500 mg BID; max. dose: 6000 mg/24 hr. Doses >3 g/24 hr has not shown to provide additional benefit and is associated with more side effects.
Use with caution in renal impairment (reduce dose; see Chapter 31) and other CNS depressants (enhanced effects). Can cause progressive and permanent vision loss (risk increases with dose and duration); periodic vision testing is required. Common side effects in children and adults include rash, weight gain, GI disturbances, arthralgia, visual disturbances, vertigo, sedation, headache, confusion, and URIs. Liver failure, anemia, psychotic disorder, angioedema, Stevens Johnson syndrome, TEN, alopecia, and suicidal ideation have been reported. Dose-dependent abnormal MRIs and intramyelinic edema (in postmortem exams) have been reported in infants treated for infantile spasms.
Ketorolac, naproxen, and mefloquine may decrease the effect of vigabatrin. Vigabatrin may decrease the effects/levels of phenytoin but increase the levels/toxicity of carbamazepine.
Use in adjunctive therapy for refractory complex partial seizure has labeled indication for =10-yr-old
patients when potential benefits outweigh the risk of vision loss.

VIGABATRIN continued

DO NOT rapidly withdrawal therapy. Dosage needs to be tapered when discontinuing therapy to minimize increased seizure frequency. The following tapering guidelines have been recommended: Infant: decrease by 25-50 mg/kg every 3-4 days
Child: decrease dose by 1/3 every 7 days for 3 weeks
Adult: decrease by 1 g/24 hr every 7 days.
Doses may be administered with or without food. Access to this medication is restricted to prescribers and pharmacies registered under a special restricted distribution program (SABRIL REMS Program) in the United States. Call 888-457-4273 or see www.SabrilREMS.com for more information.

<6 mo: 50,000 IU/dose once daily PO × 2 days.
Infant 6 mo to <1 yr: 100,000 IU/dose once daily PO × 2 days.
Child 1-5 yr: 200,000 IU/dose once daily PO × 2 days.
Malabsorption syndrome prophylaxis:
  Child >8 yr and adult: 10,000-50,000 IU/dose once daily PO of water miscible product.
Cystic fibrosis (usually dosed in cystic fibrosis specific multi-vitamins; monitor serum concentrations):
Infant: 1,500 IU/dose once daily PO
Child 1-3 yr: 5,000 IU/dose once daily PO
Child 4-8 yr: 5,000-10,000 IU/dose once daily PO
Child =9 yr and adolescent: 10,000 IU/dose once daily PO
High doses above the U.S. RDA are teratogenic (category X). The use of vitamin A in measles is recommended in children 6 mo-2 yr of age who are either hospitalized or who have any of the following risk factors: immunodeficiency, ophthalmologic evidence of vitamin A deficiency, impaired GI absorption, moderate to severe malnutrition, and recent immigration from areas with high measles mortality. May cause GI disturbance, rash, headache, increased ICP (pseudotumor cerebri), papilledema, and irritability. Large doses may increase the effects of warfarin. Mineral oil, cholestyramine and neomycin will reduce vitamin A absorption. Do not access vitamin A levels during an acute inflammatory condition as falsely low levels have been reported.

Contraindicated with concomitant administration with rifampin, carbamazepine, long-acting barbiturates, ritonavir, efavirenz, rifabutin, ergot alkaloids, or St. John's Wort (decreases voriconazole levels); and with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, or sirolimus (voriconazole increases levels of these drugs to increase side effects). Use with caution in proarrhythmic conditions (e.g., congenital/acquired QTc prolongation, cardiomyopathy, and sinus bradycardia), severe hepatic disease, galactose intolerance, and concurrent use with CYP 450 3A4 substrates that can lead to prolonged QTc interval (e.g., cisapride, pimozide, and quinidine).
Drug is a substrate and inhibitor for CYP 450 2C9, 2C19 (major substrate), and 3A4 isoenzymes. Specific CYP 2C19 phenotype and use recommendation for children and adults are as follows:

VORICONAZOLE continued
Currently approved for use in invasive aspergillosis; candidemia and disseminated candidiasis in skin, abdomen, kidney, bladder wall, and wounds; candidal esophagitis; and serious infections caused by Fusarium species and Scedosporium apiospermum in children =2 yr of age.
Common side effects include GI disturbances, fever, headache, hepatic abnormalities, photosensitiv- ity (higher incidence in children; avoid direct sunlight and use protective measures), rash (6%), and visual disturbances (30%). Serious but rare side effects include anaphylaxis, liver or renal failure, and Stevens-Johnsons syndrome. Pancreatitis has been reported in children. Monitor serum transaminase and bilirubin levels weekly for the first month of therapy followed by reduced frequency has been recommended. Higher frequency of LFT elevations has reported with children. Dermatological follow up is recommended for those who develop photosensitivity reactions as squamous cell carcinoma has been reported in those who experience this adverse reaction.
Correct potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels before and during voriconazole therapy. Adjust dose in hepatic impairment by decreasing only the maintenance dose by 50% for patients with a Child-Pugh Class A or B. Do not use IV dosage form for patients with GFR <50 mL/min because
of accumulation of the cyclodextrin excipient; switch to oral therapy if possible. Patients receiving concurrent phenytoin should increase their voriconazole maintenance doses (IV: 5 mg/kg/dose Q 12 hr; PO: double the usual dose).
Inter-occasion pharmacokinetic variability is high, thus requiring serum level monitoring. Therapeutic levels: trough: 1-5.5 mg/L. Levels <1 mg/L have resulted in treatment failures and levels >5.5 mg/L have resulted in neurotoxicity such as encephalopathy. Recommended serum sampling time: obtain trough within 30 min prior to a dose. Steady state is typically achieved after 5-7 days of initiating therapy.
Oral bioequivalence of the oral suspension and tablet has not been evaluated in children. Administer IV over 1-2 hr with a max. rate of 3 mg/kg/hr at a concentration = 5 mg/mL. Administer oral doses 1 hr before and after meals.

Usual maintenance dose for INR goal of 2-3 (see remarks): ~0.1 mg/kg/24 hr PO once daily; range: 0.05-0.34 mg/kg/24 hr. Reported average dosages include the following:
Infant < 1 yr: 0.33 mg/kg/24 hr PO once daily
Adolescent 11-18 yr: 0.09 mg/kg/24 hr PO once daily
Adult (see remarks): 5-10 mg PO once daily × 2-5 days. Adjust dose to achieve the desired INR or PT. Maintenance dose range: 2-10 mg/24 hr PO once daily.
Contraindicated in severe liver or kidney disease, uncontrolled bleeding, GI ulcers, and malignant hypertension. Acts on vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X. Side effects include fever, skin lesions, skin necrosis (especially in protein C deficiency), anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hemorrhage, and hemoptysis.
Warfarin is a substrate for CYP 450 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C18, 2C19, and 3A3/4. Amiodarone, azole anti- fungals (e.g., fluconazole, voriconazole), broad spectrum antibiotics (e.g., cefepime, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam), chloramphenicol, chloral hydrate, cimetidine, corticosteroids, delavirdine, fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin), fluoxetine, metronidazole, indomethacin, large doses of vitamins A or E, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, omeprazole, oxandrolone, quini- dine, salicylates, SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline), sulfonamides, and zafirlukast may increase warfarin's effect. Ascorbic acid, barbiturates, carbamazepine, cholestyramine, dicloxacil- lin, griseofulvin, oral contraceptives, nafcillin, ribavirin, rifampin, spironolactone, sucralfate, and vitamin K (including foods with high content) may decrease warfarin's effect.

WARFARIN continued
Younger children generally require higher doses to achieve desired effect. Children receiving Fontan cardiac surgery may require smaller doses than children with either congenital heart disease (without Fontan) or no congenital heart disease. (See Chest 2004;126:645-687S and Blood 1999;94[9]:3007-3014 for additional information.)
Lower doses should be considered for patients with pharmacogenetic variations in CYP 2C9 (e.g.,
*2 and *3 alleles) and VKORC1 (e.g., 1639G>A allele) enzymes, especially in European ancestry. Elderly and/or debilitated patients, and patients with a potential to exhibit greater than expected PT/INR response to warfarin should also consider using of lower doses.

Use with caution in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. Dosage reduction is recommended in severe renal impairment and may be necessary in hepatic dysfunction. Drug penetrates well into the CNS. Most common side effects include: anemia, granulocytopenia, nausea, and headache (dosage reduction, erythropoietin, filgrastim/GCSF, or discontinuance may be required depending on event). Seizures, confusion, rash, myositis, myopathy (use > 1 yr), hepatitis, and elevated liver enzymes have been reported. Macrocytosis is noted after 4 wk of therapy and can be
used as an indicator of compliance. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported. Neutropenia and severe anemia have been reported in advanced HIV disease. Use of injectable dosage form may cause allergic reactions in latex-sensitive individuals.
Do not use in combination with stavudine because of poor antiretroviral effect. Effects of interacting drugs include: increased toxicity (acyclovir, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole); increased hematological toxicity (ganciclovir, interferon-alpha, marrow suppressive drugs); and granulocytopenia (drugs which affect glucuronidation). Methadone, atovaquone, cimetidine, valproic acid, probenecid, and fluconazole may increase levels of zidovudine, whereas rifampin, rifabutin, and clarithromycin may decrease levels.


ZIDOVUDINE continued

U.S. RDA: See Chapter 21.
For supplementation in parenteral nutrition, see Chapter 21.
Nausea, vomiting, GI disturbances, leukopenia, and diaphoresis may occur. Gastric ulcers, hypotension, and tachycardia may occur at high doses. Patients with excessive losses (burns) or impaired absorption require higher doses. Therapeutic levels: 70-130 mCg/dL.
Parenteral products may contain aluminum; use with caution in renal impairment. May decrease the absorption of penicillamine, tetracycline, and fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin). Drugs that
increase gastric pH (e.g., H2 antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) can reduce the absorption of zinc. Excessive zinc administration can cause copper deficiency.
Approximately 20%-30% of oral dose is absorbed. Oral doses may be administered with food if GI upset occurs. Pregnancy category is "A" for zinc acetate and "C" for all other salt forms.

Treatment of acute migraines with or without aura:
Nasal (safety of an average of > 4 headaches in a 30-day period has not been established; see remarks):
= 12 yr and adult: Start with 2.5 mg inhaled into a single nostril × 1. If needed in 2 hr, a second
dose may be administered. Dose may be increased to a maximum single dose of 5 mg if needed.
Max. daily dose: 10 mg/24 hr.
Patients receiving concurrent cimetidine: Limit maximum doses to 2.5 mg as the max. single dose and do not exceed 5 mg in any 24 hr period.
Oral (Safety and efficacy in children have not been established with the oral route. One randomized placebo-controlled trial in 696 adolescents 12-17 yr old did not establish efficacy and had similar adverse events as seen in adult trials):
Adult (Safety of an average of > 3 headaches in a 30-day period has not been established; see remarks):
PO tabs: Start with 1.25-2.5 mg PO × 1. If needed in 2 hr, a second dose may be administered. Dose may be increased to a maximum single dose of 5 mg if needed. Max. daily dose: 10 mg/24 hr.
ODT tabs: Use the same dosage recommendation for PO tabs but with a 2.5 mg initial dose.
Patients receiving concurrent cimetidine: Limit maximum doses to 2.5 mg as the max. single dose and do not exceed 5 mg in any 24 hr period for both PO and ODT tabs.
Contraindicated in ischemic bowel disease; ischemic coronary artery disease; uncontrolled hypertension; peripheral vascular disease; history of stroke or TIA, arrhythmias, hemiplegic, or basilar migraine; significant cardiovascular disease; and coronary artery vasospasm.
Do not administer with any ergot-containing medications, any other 5-HT1 agonist (e.g., triptans), methylene blue, or within 2 wk of discontinuing a MAO inhibitor or linezolid. Cimetidine may increase the zolmitriptan levels; see dosage section for reduced maximum dosage. Patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors and negative cardiovascular evaluation should have their first dose administered in a medically supervised facility.
Use not recommended in moderate/severe hepatic impairment. Severe renal impairment (CrCl 5-25 mL/min) reduces zolmitriptan clearance by 25%.
Common adverse reactions for all dosage forms unless otherwise indicated include nausea, taste alteration (nasal route), xerostomia, dizziness, hyperesthesia (nasal route), paresthesia, somno- lence, sensation of hot and cold, throat pain, and asthenia (oral route). Hypertension, coronary artery spasm, MI, cerebral hemorrhage, and headaches have been reported.
For intranasal use, blow nose gently prior to dosing. Block opposite nostril while administering dose by breathing in gently.
When using the ODT, place the whole tablet on the tongue, allow the tablet to dissolve, and swallow with saliva. Administration with liquids is optional. Do not break the ODT tablet.

Infantile spasms (regimen that was effective in a small study from Japan; additional studies needed): Start with 2-4 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ BID. Then increase by 2-5 mg/kg/24 hr every 2-4 day until seizures disappear, up to a maximum of 20 mg/kg/24 hr.
> 16 yr-adult:
Adjunctive therapy for partial seizures: 100 mg PO once daily × 2 wk. Dose may be increased to 200 mg PO once daily × 2 wk. Additional dosage increments of 100 mg/24 hr can be made at 2-wk intervals to allow attainment of steady-state levels. Effective doses have ranged from 100-600 mg/24 hr ÷ once daily-BID (BID dosing may provide better efficacy). No additional benefit has been shown for doses > 400 mg/24 hr.
Because zonisamide is a sulfonamide, it is contraindicated in patients allergic to sulfonamides (may result in Stevens-Johnson syndrome or TEN). Common side effects of drowsiness, ataxia, anorexia, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, rash, and pruritis usually occur early in therapy and can be minimized with slow dose titration. Children are at increased risk for hyperthermia and oligohydrosis, especially in warm or hot weather. Suicidal behavior or ideation, acute pancreatitis, urolithiasis, metabolic acidosis (more frequent and severe in younger patients), DRESS/multi-organ hypersensitivity, rhabdomyolysis, and elevated creatinine phosphokinase have been reported.
Although not fully delineated, therapeutic serum levels of 20-30 mg/L have been suggested as higher rates of adverse reactions have been seen at levels > 30 mg/L.
Zonisamide is a CYP 450 3A4 substrate. Phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital can decrease levels of zonisamide.
Use with caution in renal or hepatic impairment; slower dose titration and more frequent monitoring is recommended. Do not use if GFR is <50 mL/min. Avoid abrupt discontinuation or radical dose reductions. Swallow capsules whole and do not crush or chew.

 I. DOSE ADJUSTMENT METHODS	
A. Maintenance Dose
In patients with renal insufficiency, the dose may be adjusted using the following methods:
1. Interval extension (I): Lengthen intervals between individual doses, keeping dose size normal. For this method, a suggested interval is shown.
2. Dose reduction (D): Reduce number of individual doses, keeping interval between doses normal; recommended when relatively constant blood level of drug is desired. For this method, percentage of usual dose
is shown. For some medications and indications, specific dosing is provided.
3. Interval extension and dose reduction (DI): Both lengthen interval and reduce dose.
4. Interval extension or dose reduction (D, I): In some instances, either dose or interval can be changed.
NOTE: These dose adjustment methods do not apply to patients in the neo- natal period. For neonatal renal dosing, please consult a neonatal dosage reference (see Chapter 18). Dose modifications given are only approxima- tions and may not be appropriate for all patients or indications. Each patient must be monitored closely for signs of drug toxicity, and serum levels must be measured when available; drug doses and intervals should be adjusted accordingly. When in doubt, always consult a nephrologist or pharmacist who has expertise in renal dosing.
B. Dialysis
General recommendations are provided when available. However, factors such as patient age, indication for use, residual native kidney function, specific peritoneal dialysis (PD) or intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) settings, etc., will affect the medication dosing needs of each individual patient.
Consult with a nephrologist or pharmacist who is familiar with medication dosing in dialysis prior to prescribing medications for a dialysis patient.
